<h2>Breed Overview</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is one of the most visually striking dogs in the canine world — a living work of art that combines aristocratic elegance with breathtaking athletic ability. Known for centuries as the Russian Wolfhound, this ancient sighthound was bred by Russian nobility to chase and catch wolves across vast open steppes, and every inch of the breed reflects that extraordinary heritage. Long, silky coat flowing in the wind; a narrow, sculpted head; and a lean, deep-chested body built for explosive speed — the Borzoi is a dog that genuinely stops people in their tracks.</p>

<p>Despite their regal appearance and somewhat aloof demeanor, Borzois are affectionate and deeply bonded companions at home. They are calm indoors, surprisingly gentle, and possess a quiet dignity that many owners find utterly captivating. This is not a boisterous, in-your-face breed — but for the right person, the Borzoi's subtle, thoughtful personality is far more rewarding than any amount of tail-wagging enthusiasm.</p>

<h3>A Brief History</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's origins trace back to 17th-century Russia, where aristocrats and the Tsar's court developed the breed through crossing Arabian Greyhounds with native Russian sheepdogs to produce a dog capable of withstanding brutal winters while still possessing the speed to run down wolves. These hunts were elaborate social events involving hundreds of horses, hounds, and beaters — the Borzoi was at the center of it all.</p>

<p>Following the Russian Revolution of 1917, the breed nearly vanished as the nobility that kept them was decimated. Fortunately, the Borzoi had already made its way to Western Europe and America by the late 1800s, largely as gifts from the Russian Imperial family. The American Kennel Club officially recognized the Borzoi in 1891, making it one of the earlier AKC-recognized breeds. Today, the breed competes in AKC's Hound Group and remains a beloved fixture in lure coursing, conformation showing, and devoted family homes.</p>

</ul>

<h3>What Makes the Borzoi Unique</h3>

<p>What truly sets the Borzoi apart — beyond the obvious physical beauty — is the combination of qualities that seem almost contradictory. This is a dog that can reach speeds of up to 35–40 mph and was historically used to overpower wolves, yet inside the home it behaves with cat-like quietness and composure. They rarely bark without reason. They are sensitive to harsh words or chaotic environments. They often choose one or two people to bond with deeply, displaying a loyalty that is quiet but unmistakably real.</p>

<p>Borzois are also a breed that demands a certain kind of owner. They are not for people who want an obedient, people-pleasing dog that responds to commands on the first ask. Their independent nature — a necessity when hunting autonomously at high speeds — means they think for themselves. This can be mistaken for stubbornness, but experienced Borzoi owners understand it as simply part of who the dog is. Embrace it, and you'll have one of the most uniquely rewarding relationships in dogdom.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="temperament">
<h2>Temperament & Personality</h2>

<p>Living with a Borzoi is an experience unlike owning almost any other breed. They are simultaneously aloof and affectionate, independent and devoted, athletic and deeply lazy on the couch. Understanding the Borzoi temperament means letting go of expectations built around more conventional dogs and appreciating a personality that is genuinely one of a kind.</p>

<h3>The "Cat of the Dog World"</h3>

<p>Borzoi owners frequently describe their dogs as cat-like, and it's an apt comparison. Like cats, Borzois are selective with their affection — they don't rush to greet every stranger with enthusiasm, and they reserve their deepest loyalty for a small circle of trusted people. Also like cats, they are more likely to decide when and how they want interaction rather than constantly seeking approval. This can feel stand-offish to those expecting golden retriever-style exuberance, but to Borzoi devotees, it makes moments of genuine affection all the more meaningful.</p>

<p>At home, Borzois tend to be remarkably calm and gentle. They enjoy lounging — often in comically dramatic sprawls across sofas and floors — and are generally quiet dogs who don't bark excessively. Many owners are surprised to discover just how peaceful life with a Borzoi can be indoors.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity and Emotional Intelligence</h3>

<p>The Borzoi is a notably sensitive breed. They pick up on the emotional tone of their household with remarkable accuracy and are easily stressed by tension, loud voices, or chaotic environments. Harsh training methods are particularly counterproductive — a Borzoi who has been scolded harshly may simply shut down, refuse to engage, or develop anxiety. This sensitivity, however, also means they form deep emotional connections and can be wonderfully intuitive companions.</p>

<p>They are not, as a rule, a good fit for loud, unpredictable households. They thrive in calm homes where routines are consistent and their quiet dignity is respected.</p>

<h3>Behavior with Family</h3>

<p>With their own family, Borzois are typically warm and affectionate, though usually not over-the-top demonstrative. Many will shadow a favorite person from room to room, lean gently against them, or rest a long head on a knee. They are often described as velcro dogs in disguise — they may not bounce and bark for attention, but they very much want to be near the people they love.</p>

<p>Borzois generally do well with older children who understand how to interact respectfully with dogs. Their large size and somewhat delicate build means they can be accidentally injured by very young, rough children, and they may become anxious around unpredictable toddler behavior. Supervision is always recommended. With other dogs — particularly other sighthounds — Borzois typically coexist peacefully. Small animals are a different matter entirely (see below).</p>

<h3>The Prey Drive Reality</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most important temperament trait for prospective Borzoi owners to understand is prey drive. These dogs were bred for centuries to sight, chase, and catch fast-moving animals — and that instinct is still very much alive. A squirrel, a rabbit, a small dog seen across a park — any of these can trigger an explosive chase response that is nearly impossible to interrupt once it starts. A Borzoi off-leash in an unsecured area is a Borzoi in danger. This is non-negotiable: Borzois must be exercised in securely fenced areas or on leash at all times outdoors.</p>

<p>Small household pets — cats, rabbits, guinea pigs — can be at serious risk around a Borzoi, especially one raised without them. Some Borzois learn to coexist peacefully with cats they were raised alongside, but this varies significantly by individual dog and should never be assumed safe without careful introduction and supervision.</p>

<h3>Independence and Intelligence</h3>

<p>Borzois are intelligent but independent. They were bred to make split-second decisions in the field without human direction, which means they don't have the same ingrained need to please and defer to humans that many other breeds do. This shows up in training — they understand what you're asking, they simply weigh whether they feel like complying. Training sessions need to be short (10–15 minutes), positive, and genuinely engaging. Food motivation is strong in most Borzois and is your best training tool. Consistency and patience are essential. Those who approach the Borzoi with humor and adaptability find training rewarding; those who expect quick, unconditional obedience will be frustrated.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="physical">
<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

<p>The Borzoi's appearance is one of the most immediately recognizable in the dog world — fluid, elegant, and unmistakably purposeful. Every physical feature of this breed tells the story of its function: a body built for extraordinary speed, endurance in cold climates, and the strength to take down prey larger than itself. The AKC breed standard describes the Borzoi as "an aristocratic, rather long dog, slightly higher at the hindquarters than at the withers, with a long, lean head, and an elegant, but muscular body."</p>

<h3>Size and Build</h3>

<p>The Borzoi is a large to giant breed with a distinctive lean, muscular frame. According to the AKC standard, males stand at least 28 inches at the shoulder (most range 28–32 inches) and weigh 75–105 pounds, while females stand at least 26 inches and weigh 60–85 pounds. Despite their size, they appear lighter than they are because of their narrow, streamlined build. Their deep chest, tucked abdomen, and long legs give them the classic sighthound silhouette — think of a Greyhound but longer, more coated, and more dramatically sculpted.</p>

<p>The back has a characteristic upward curve, particularly pronounced over the loin — this arched topline is a hallmark of the breed and an essential feature of the sighthound's running mechanics, allowing the spine to flex and extend dramatically during the full-speed gallop that gives them their explosive reach.</p>

<h3>Head and Expression</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's head is long, lean, and narrow — one of the most distinctive head shapes in dogdom. Viewed from the side, the skull and muzzle form an almost unbroken, gently curved line. There is no stop (the indentation between muzzle and skull common in many breeds) — the profile flows continuously from occiput to nose. The eyes are dark, almond-shaped, and set obliquely, giving an expression that is simultaneously gentle and keenly intelligent. Ears are small, folded back along the neck at rest, and raised slightly when the dog is alert. The overall expression is one of quiet nobility.</p>

<h3>Coat and Colors</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's coat is one of its most glorious features — long, silky, and either wavy or loosely curly. The coat is flat or wavy on the body, with a profuse frill on the neck and chest, feathering on the legs and tail, and a longer, softer undercoat during winter months. The texture should never be woolly or harsh; the AKC standard calls for a silky quality throughout.</p>

<p>One of the more liberating aspects of the Borzoi standard is its approach to color: any color or combination of colors is acceptable. You'll find Borzois in white, black, cream, red, brindle, sable, and stunning combinations thereof — with or without white markings. This means no two Borzois look quite alike, and their color variety is part of the breed's visual appeal.</p>

<h3>Grooming Needs</h3>

<p>Despite the impressive coat, Borzois are somewhat easier to groom than their appearance suggests. The silky, non-matting texture of a proper Borzoi coat means it doesn't tangle as aggressively as coats with a softer, denser undercoat. That said, regular maintenance is still required:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Brushing:</strong> 2–3 times per week minimum; daily during seasonal shedding periods (spring and fall)</li>
  <li><strong>Bathing:</strong> Every 4–6 weeks, or as needed; the silky coat tends to stay relatively clean</li>
  <li><strong>Ear cleaning:</strong> Weekly check and cleaning to prevent infection</li>
  <li><strong>Nail trimming:</strong> Every 3–4 weeks; long nails can cause gait problems in this athletic breed</li>
  <li><strong>Dental care:</strong> Daily brushing recommended; dental disease is common in the breed</li>
</ul>

<p>Professional grooming is recommended every 6–8 weeks for owners who prefer not to handle the full coat themselves, with costs typically ranging from $75–$150 per session depending on location and coat condition.</p>

<h3>Movement and Athletic Ability</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's movement is as distinctive as its appearance. At a walk or trot, the gait is smooth, effortless, and remarkably graceful — long strides that cover ground with minimal effort. At full speed, the Borzoi employs the double-suspension gallop used by all coursing sighthounds, reaching top speeds of 35–40 mph. The flexibility of the spine is what makes this possible — the body fully extends and contracts with each stride, momentarily leaving the ground entirely at both the full extension and full contraction of the gallop cycle. Watching a Borzoi run at full speed is, by any measure, one of the most beautiful spectacles in the animal kingdom.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="right-for-you">
<h2>Is This Breed Right for You?</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is an extraordinary dog — but it is emphatically not the right dog for everyone. Their unique combination of physical needs, temperamental quirks, and lifestyle requirements means that the best Borzoi owners tend to be those who have done their research, adjusted their expectations accordingly, and genuinely appreciate what makes this breed different. If that sounds like you, a Borzoi can be one of the most deeply rewarding companions you'll ever have. If it doesn't, there are wonderful breeds better suited to your lifestyle. Here's how to tell which camp you're in.</p>

<h3>The Borzoi Thrives With...</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Calm, patient owners</strong> who appreciate a dog with an independent mind and won't mistake it for defiance</li>
  <li><strong>Experienced dog owners</strong> — not necessarily with sighthounds specifically, but people who understand that different breeds require different approaches</li>
  <li><strong>People with a securely fenced yard</strong> — a 5–6 foot fence minimum is essential; Borzois can and will clear shorter fences</li>
  <li><strong>Active households</strong> that can provide 45–60 minutes of exercise daily, including opportunities to run freely in a safe, enclosed space</li>
  <li><strong>Families with older children</strong> (generally 8 and up) who know how to interact gently with dogs</li>
  <li><strong>Those who appreciate a quieter, more reflective canine companion</strong> rather than a constantly enthusiastic, eager-to-please dog</li>
  <li><strong>People who enjoy grooming</strong> or are willing to budget for regular professional grooming</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Borzoi Is Probably Not Right for You If...</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You want a highly obedient, command-responsive dog.</strong> Borzois can learn commands, but off-leash reliability — especially around prey animals — is extremely difficult to achieve and should never be fully trusted.</li>
  <li><strong>You have a small, unfenced yard or live in an apartment with limited outdoor space.</strong> While Borzois are calm indoors, they need real exercise and safe space to move.</li>
  <li><strong>You have very young children or toddlers</strong> who move unpredictably. The Borzoi's sensitivity and physical delicacy can create a stressful match.</li>
  <li><strong>You have small pets — cats, rabbits, guinea pigs, birds.</strong> Prey drive is strong and deeply instinctive; even well-socialized Borzois can be dangerous to small animals.</li>
  <li><strong>You prefer a low-maintenance coat.</strong> The silky, flowing coat requires consistent grooming investment.</li>
  <li><strong>You want a guard dog or watchdog.</strong> Borzois are not territorial or aggressive; they are unlikely to deter intruders or alert you reliably to strangers.</li>
  <li><strong>You have a high-energy, chaotic household.</strong> These sensitive dogs do not thrive in noisy, unpredictable environments.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Living Situation Considerations</h3>

<p>While Borzois are calm indoors and don't require a mansion to be happy, they do need space to stretch their considerable frames. A home with a securely fenced yard of at least medium size is ideal. The fence height is critical — 5 feet is the absolute minimum, and 6 feet is strongly preferred. Standard 4-foot residential fencing is not sufficient. Underground or invisible fences are also not recommended for Borzois; their prey drive can easily override the deterrent if they spot something worth chasing.</p>

<p>Apartment living is possible for a Borzoi with an extremely committed owner who provides daily off-leash running in secure spaces such as a fenced dog park or coursing field, but it is not the ideal scenario. These dogs need to run — not just walk — on a regular basis to stay physically and mentally healthy.</p>

<h3>Financial Commitment</h3>

<p>Owning a Borzoi comes with real financial considerations beyond the initial purchase price:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Purchase price:</strong> $1,500–$3,500 from a reputable breeder</li>
  <li><strong>Annual food cost:</strong> $800–$1,500 (large breed; quality food matters for this breed's health)</li>
  <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> $75–$150 per professional session; $400–$900 annually if done every 6–8 weeks</li>
  <li><strong>Veterinary care:</strong> $500–$1,000+ annually for routine care; Borzois are prone to bloat (GDV), which can require emergency surgery costing $3,000–$6,000</li>
  <li><strong>Pet insurance:</strong> Strongly recommended given bloat risk; $50–$100/month for a large breed</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Reward of Getting It Right</h3>

<p>For those who genuinely suit the Borzoi's needs, the reward is extraordinary. These are dogs that will surprise you with their quiet humor, their sudden bursts of zoomies-style silliness, and the depth of loyalty they quietly extend to the people they love. They are the kind of dog that non-dog-people stop to admire on walks — and the kind that dog people with experience deeply respect. A Borzoi isn't for everyone, but for the right person, there is simply nothing else like them.</p>

<h2>Common Health Issues in the Borzoi</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is generally a hardy breed, but like all purebred dogs, they carry certain genetic predispositions that every owner should understand. Knowing what to watch for — and working proactively with a knowledgeable vet — can add years to your Borzoi's life and keep them comfortable throughout it.</p>

<h3>Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus)</h3>
<p>Bloat is the single most serious health threat facing the Borzoi. As a deep-chested, large sighthound, the Borzoi is anatomically predisposed to gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), a life-threatening condition in which the stomach fills with gas and twists on itself. GDV can kill within hours without emergency surgical intervention. Signs include a visibly distended abdomen, unproductive retching, excessive drooling, restlessness, and collapse. Many Borzoi owners and breeders opt for a prophylactic gastropexy — a surgical procedure that tacks the stomach to the abdominal wall — performed at the time of spay or neuter to prevent the deadly twist. If your dog shows any signs of bloat, treat it as an emergency and get to a veterinary clinic immediately.</p>

<h3>Cardiac Issues</h3>
<p>Borzois are known to have hearts that beat more slowly than average dogs and may display low blood pressure, which is entirely normal for the breed. However, they can be susceptible to dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and other cardiac conditions. It's important that your vet is familiar with sighthound physiology, as values considered normal in other breeds may be flagged incorrectly in a Borzoi. Annual cardiac screenings are recommended for breeding dogs and are a good idea for all Borzois over the age of five.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity to Anesthesia</h3>
<p>This is a critical point that every Borzoi owner must communicate to any veterinarian or emergency clinic treating their dog. Sighthounds like the Borzoi have very low body fat and a unique liver metabolism that makes them highly sensitive to certain anesthetic agents — particularly barbiturates like thiopental. A standard dose that's safe for a Labrador can be lethal for a Borzoi. Always ensure your vet is experienced with sighthounds and uses appropriate anesthetic protocols, such as those based on propofol or isoflurane.</p>

<h3>Degenerative Myelopathy</h3>
<p>Degenerative myelopathy (DM) is a progressive neurological disease that affects the spinal cord, leading to weakness and eventual paralysis of the hind limbs. While not exclusive to the Borzoi, DM does appear in the breed. Responsible breeders test for the SOD1 gene mutation associated with DM before breeding. Dogs who are genetically "at risk" (homozygous for the mutation) don't always develop the disease, but the odds are significantly increased.</p>

<h3>Osteosarcoma</h3>
<p>Large and giant breeds are disproportionately affected by bone cancer, and the Borzoi is no exception. Osteosarcoma most commonly affects the long bones of the limbs and tends to present with lameness, swelling, and pain around a joint. The average age of onset is between 7 and 10 years. Early detection is critical, as osteosarcoma is an aggressive cancer. Any persistent limping in a middle-aged or senior Borzoi should be evaluated with X-rays promptly.</p>

<h3>Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)</h3>
<p>Progressive retinal atrophy is an inherited eye condition that causes gradual deterioration of the retina, eventually leading to blindness. Borzois can carry genes associated with PRA, and reputable breeders screen their dogs through the Canine Eye Registry Foundation (CERF) or OFA Eye Certification Registry. Dogs typically first show signs of night blindness before losing daytime vision. While there is no cure, affected dogs often adapt well to their environment.</p>

<h3>Hypothyroidism</h3>
<p>Hypothyroidism — an underactive thyroid gland — is seen with some regularity in the breed. Symptoms include unexplained weight gain, lethargy, coat changes, skin problems, and cold intolerance. Diagnosis is made through blood testing, and the condition is manageable with daily oral medication (levothyroxine). Keep in mind that normal thyroid ranges established for other breeds may not apply directly to Borzois; your vet should interpret results in the context of sighthound physiology.</p>

<h3>Orthopedic Concerns</h3>
<p>Given their athletic build and high-speed galloping capability, Borzois are susceptible to soft tissue injuries, particularly to the muscles, tendons, and ligaments of the legs. Sudden lameness after exercise should always be evaluated. Additionally, some Borzois experience issues with angular limb deformities as puppies, so responsible breeders monitor skeletal development closely during the growth phase.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="vet-care">
<h2>Veterinary Care Schedule for the Borzoi</h2>

<p>Staying ahead of your Borzoi's health requires more than just showing up when something looks wrong. A structured, breed-aware veterinary care schedule helps catch problems early and keeps your elegant companion in peak condition throughout every life stage. Crucially, finding a vet who is familiar with sighthound physiology — or who is willing to learn — makes an enormous difference in the quality of care your Borzoi receives.</p>

<h3>Puppy Wellness (8 Weeks to 1 Year)</h3>
<p>Borzoi puppies require a series of core vaccinations starting at 8 weeks of age. The standard schedule typically includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>8 weeks:</strong> First DHPP combination vaccine (Distemper, Hepatitis, Parvovirus, Parainfluenza)</li>
  <li><strong>12 weeks:</strong> Second DHPP booster</li>
  <li><strong>16 weeks:</strong> Third DHPP booster and rabies vaccine (timing may vary by local law)</li>
  <li><strong>12–16 months:</strong> DHPP and rabies boosters</li>
</ul>
<p>Because Borzois grow rapidly and are a giant breed, your vet should also monitor skeletal development during this stage. Discuss appropriate nutrition carefully — overfeeding or over-supplementing calcium in large breed puppies can contribute to developmental orthopedic problems. Expect puppy wellness visits to cost between $75 and $200 per visit depending on your location, vaccines given, and additional services.</p>
<p>Spay and neuter timing is a topic worth discussing in depth with your vet. Many orthopedic specialists and large-breed experts now recommend waiting until 18–24 months for giant breeds, allowing the growth plates to fully close. At the time of spay or neuter, discuss prophylactic gastropexy to significantly reduce the risk of life-threatening GDV.</p>

<h3>Annual Wellness Exams (Ages 1–7)</h3>
<p>Once your Borzoi is through the puppy phase, annual wellness exams become the cornerstone of preventive care. Each annual visit should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full physical examination, including heart auscultation and lymph node palpation</li>
  <li>Weight check (healthy adult Borzois typically range from 60–105 lbs, with males at the higher end)</li>
  <li>Fecal examination for intestinal parasites</li>
  <li>Heartworm test (annually, even on preventive)</li>
  <li>Core vaccine boosters (DHPP every 3 years after initial series; rabies per local law)</li>
  <li>Dental evaluation — tartar buildup is common in the breed</li>
  <li>Discussion of diet, exercise, and any behavioral changes</li>
</ul>
<p>Budget approximately $150–$350 for a standard annual wellness visit. Annual heartworm and flea/tick prevention medications add roughly $100–$250 per year depending on your region and product choices. Note that some monthly heartworm preventives containing ivermectin are generally safe for Borzois, unlike in some herding breeds with the MDR1 mutation — but always confirm with your vet.</p>

<h3>Breed-Specific Screening Recommendations</h3>
<p>The Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) and responsible Borzoi breeders recommend the following health clearances and screenings:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Cardiac evaluation:</strong> OFA cardiac exam, recommended annually for breeding dogs and for all dogs over age 5</li>
  <li><strong>Eye certification:</strong> OFA Eye Certification Registry (ECR) exam to screen for PRA and other inherited eye conditions</li>
  <li><strong>DM genetic testing:</strong> DNA test for the SOD1 degenerative myelopathy mutation</li>
  <li><strong>Thyroid panel:</strong> OFA thyroid evaluation, ideally interpreted by someone familiar with sighthound reference ranges</li>
</ul>
<p>These screenings typically cost between $50 and $150 each and can often be done during a regular vet visit or through a veterinary cardiologist or ophthalmologist.</p>

<h3>Dental Care</h3>
<p>Borzois are prone to tartar accumulation and periodontal disease, partly due to the narrow, elongated jaw structure that is characteristic of sighthound breeds. Professional dental cleanings under anesthesia are typically recommended every 1–2 years. Given the breed's anesthetic sensitivity, ensure your veterinary team uses a sighthound-appropriate anesthesia protocol. Professional cleanings cost between $300 and $800 depending on the extent of work required. Daily tooth brushing at home is the single most effective preventive measure.</p>

<h3>Senior Care (Ages 7 and Up)</h3>
<p>Borzois are generally considered senior dogs at around 7–8 years of age. At this stage, twice-yearly vet visits become the new standard of care. Senior wellness exams should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Comprehensive bloodwork panel (CBC, chemistry, thyroid)</li>
  <li>Urinalysis</li>
  <li>Blood pressure measurement</li>
  <li>Chest X-rays if cardiac concerns are present</li>
  <li>Joint assessment for early arthritis signs</li>
  <li>Any relevant cancer screening if symptoms suggest it (e.g., X-rays for limb pain)</li>
</ul>
<p>Senior bloodwork panels typically run $150–$350. The investment in twice-yearly visits pays significant dividends in early disease detection and quality of life.</p>

<h3>Parasite Prevention Year-Round</h3>
<p>Year-round heartworm prevention is recommended regardless of climate. Monthly oral preventives or topical treatments are both effective options. Flea, tick, and intestinal parasite prevention should also be maintained consistently. Always consult your vet before switching products, and confirm that any medication is safe for use in sighthound breeds specifically.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="lifespan">
<h2>Lifespan & Aging in the Borzoi</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is a large to giant breed with a lifespan that falls on the higher end of expectations for dogs of their size. With excellent care, a healthy Borzoi can be a cherished companion for a decade or more — bringing their quiet elegance and affectionate nature to your home through every life stage.</p>

<h3>Average Lifespan</h3>
<p>The typical Borzoi lives between <strong>9 and 14 years</strong>, with the median falling around 10–12 years. This is notably longer than many other giant breeds (such as the Great Dane, whose average is closer to 7–9 years), which reflects the Borzoi's lean physique and centuries of natural selection for endurance and athleticism. Dogs from health-tested lines, maintained at a lean body weight with appropriate exercise and nutrition, are most likely to reach the upper end of this range.</p>

<h3>Life Stages</h3>

<h3>Puppyhood (0–18 Months)</h3>
<p>Borzoi puppies grow rapidly and don't reach full physical maturity until around 18 months to 2 years of age, with some males continuing to fill out in chest and muscle until age 3 or 4. During this stage, the focus should be on controlled exercise — avoid repetitive high-impact activities like long runs on hard surfaces, as the growth plates are still open and vulnerable to injury. Socialization is critically important during the first 16 weeks of life, as Borzois can become reserved or wary around strangers if not adequately exposed to varied people, environments, and stimuli.</p>

<h3>Young Adult (18 Months–5 Years)</h3>
<p>This is the Borzoi at their physical peak. They are athletic, agile, and capable of reaching speeds of 35–40 mph in full sprint. Young adult Borzois still benefit from a relatively structured routine of daily exercise — approximately 40–60 minutes of free running in a safely enclosed area per day is ideal, supplemented by leash walks. Mentally, they mature more slowly than many breeds, and a 2-year-old Borzoi may still display puppy-like curiosity and selective stubbornness.</p>

<h3>Mature Adult (5–8 Years)</h3>
<p>By middle age, most Borzois have settled into a calm, dignified temperament. Energy levels remain solid but the frantic activity of youth gives way to a more measured pace. This is the time to begin annual cardiac screenings if you haven't already, and to be especially vigilant about maintaining an appropriate body weight. Excess weight in middle age is one of the most significant contributors to joint problems, cardiac stress, and reduced longevity in large breeds.</p>

<h3>Senior Years (8 Years and Beyond)</h3>
<p>A Borzoi entering their senior years often does so gracefully. Many owners report that their senior Borzois are still remarkably spry and active well into their tenth or eleventh year. That said, aging brings real changes that owners need to accommodate:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Joint stiffness and arthritis:</strong> Daily gentle walks remain important, but you may need to reduce intensity and avoid cold, damp conditions that worsen joint discomfort. Orthopedic bedding, ramps instead of stairs, and joint supplements (such as fish oil, glucosamine, and chondroitin) can make a meaningful difference in comfort.</li>
  <li><strong>Muscle loss (sarcopenia):</strong> Seniors naturally lose muscle mass. Maintaining appropriate lean protein in the diet helps slow this process. Discuss protein levels with your vet, as needs change with age.</li>
  <li><strong>Cognitive changes:</strong> Some senior Borzois show signs of canine cognitive dysfunction — increased confusion, altered sleep patterns, and reduced responsiveness. Talk to your vet if you notice behavioral changes that don't have a clear physical cause.</li>
  <li><strong>Sensory decline:</strong> Hearing and vision can deteriorate with age. A Borzoi who begins ignoring recalls or seems startled easily may be experiencing hearing loss rather than defiance.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature sensitivity:</strong> Older dogs with less muscle mass and thinner coats struggle more with cold. Senior Borzois may benefit from a warm coat for winter outings.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Maximizing Longevity</h3>
<p>The most impactful things you can do to help your Borzoi live a long, healthy life include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sourcing from health-tested breeding lines with demonstrated longevity</li>
  <li>Maintaining a lean, healthy body weight throughout life</li>
  <li>Feeding a balanced, high-quality diet appropriate to life stage</li>
  <li>Providing daily exercise adapted to age and physical condition</li>
  <li>Scheduling regular veterinary wellness exams, moving to twice-yearly in senior years</li>
  <li>Addressing dental disease proactively, as chronic oral infection has systemic health consequences</li>
  <li>Taking bloat risk seriously with appropriate feeding practices (multiple smaller meals, no vigorous exercise immediately before or after eating) and considering prophylactic gastropexy</li>
</ul>

<h3>End-of-Life Considerations</h3>
<p>When your Borzoi enters their final stage of life, quality of life assessment becomes the most important ongoing conversation with your vet. Pain management, mobility support, and careful monitoring of appetite, hydration, and engagement with the world are key indicators of wellbeing. Many Borzoi owners work with a veterinarian who specializes in palliative and hospice care for pets. In-home euthanasia services are widely available and allow your Borzoi to pass peacefully in familiar surroundings, which many families find deeply meaningful.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="illness-signs">
<h2>Signs of Illness in the Borzoi</h2>

<p>Borzois are stoic dogs by nature — a trait honed over centuries of coursing in harsh Russian winters. This stoicism is admirable in the field but can be a genuine challenge when it comes to recognizing illness at home. A Borzoi may not vocalize pain, may continue to move around despite significant discomfort, and may not show obvious distress until a condition is already advanced. Learning what normal looks like for your individual dog — and recognizing when something has shifted — is one of the most valuable skills you can develop as a Borzoi owner.</p>

<h3>Emergency Warning Signs — Act Immediately</h3>
<p>The following signs require immediate emergency veterinary attention. Do not wait to see if your dog improves:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Distended, hard, or visibly bloated abdomen</strong> — this is the hallmark sign of GDV/bloat, a life-threatening emergency</li>
  <li><strong>Unproductive retching or gagging</strong> without bringing anything up — another classic GDV sign</li>
  <li><strong>Sudden collapse or inability to stand</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pale, white, blue, or grayish gums</strong> — a sign of shock, severe anemia, or cardiovascular crisis</li>
  <li><strong>Labored breathing or open-mouth breathing at rest</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Seizures</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Suspected poisoning or toxin ingestion</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Sudden onset of extreme pain</strong> — characterized by inability to settle, crying out, or aggression when touched</li>
</ul>

<h3>Signs That Warrant a Same-Day or Next-Day Vet Visit</h3>
<p>These symptoms aren't immediately life-threatening in most cases but should be evaluated promptly — within 24 hours — rather than watched and waited:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Limping or sudden onset lameness, especially in a middle-aged or older dog (rule out osteosarcoma or injury)</li>
  <li>Vomiting more than once or twice in a 24-hour period, or any vomiting accompanied by lethargy</li>
  <li>Diarrhea that is bloody, black, or accompanied by lethargy and loss of appetite</li>
  <li>Eye cloudiness, redness, discharge, or apparent vision changes</li>
  <li>Significant decrease in appetite lasting more than 24 hours</li>
  <li>Swelling anywhere on the body, particularly around a limb joint</li>
  <li>Unusual or new lumps under the skin</li>
  <li>Excessive thirst or urination (possible indicators of diabetes, kidney disease, or Cushing's syndrome)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Subtle Signs Borzoi Owners Should Know</h3>
<p>Because Borzois mask pain and illness well, some warning signs are easily overlooked. Learn to notice:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Postural changes:</strong> A dog who stands differently, shifts weight, or is reluctant to lie down may be in pain.</li>
  <li><strong>Changes in sleep patterns:</strong> Sleeping significantly more than usual, or conversely, restlessness and inability to settle at night.</li>
  <li><strong>Changes in coat quality:</strong> A dull, dry, or thinning coat in a Borzoi can signal hypothyroidism, poor nutrition, or internal disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Loss of that characteristic sighthound lean appearance:</strong> Unexplained weight gain in a dog whose diet hasn't changed can signal hypothyroidism or other hormonal issues.</li>
  <li><strong>Withdrawal and reduced engagement:</strong> A Borzoi who typically greets you but has become increasingly disinterested in interaction may be feeling unwell. This can be easy to miss in a breed that is naturally reserved.</li>
  <li><strong>Changes in gait:</strong> Watch for subtle stiffness when rising from rest, a shortened stride, or reluctance to jump up on furniture they previously enjoyed.</li>
  <li><strong>Bad breath:</strong> Beyond normal "dog breath," a foul or unusual odor from the mouth can indicate dental disease, kidney problems, or diabetes.</li>
  <li><strong>Scooting or excessive licking of the hindquarters:</strong> Signs of anal gland discomfort or skin irritation in the perineal area.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Neurological Signs to Watch For</h3>
<p>Given the Borzoi's susceptibility to degenerative myelopathy and other neurological conditions, be alert to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Weakness or wobbliness in the hind legs</li>
  <li>Dragging of one or both hind feet (knuckling over)</li>
  <li>Loss of coordination, stumbling, or difficulty navigating stairs</li>
  <li>Tilting of the head or rapid involuntary eye movements (vestibular disease)</li>
  <li>Loss of bladder or bowel control in a previously house-trained dog</li>
</ul>
<p>Any of these signs in a middle-aged or older Borzoi should be evaluated by your vet, who may recommend referral to a veterinary neurologist.</p>

<h3>Knowing Your Dog's Normal</h3>
<p>Because Borzois have atypical physiological baselines compared to most breeds — lower resting heart rates, lower blood pressure, and different normal ranges for some blood values — establishing a relationship with a vet who knows your individual dog is invaluable. Keep a simple health journal noting your Borzoi's normal weight, typical energy levels, usual eating and drinking habits, and normal stool consistency. This baseline information becomes enormously useful when something changes and you're trying to determine whether a vet visit is warranted — and it helps your veterinarian make faster, more accurate assessments when it is.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="dietary-needs">
<h2>Dietary Needs</h2>

<p>Feeding a Borzoi well is both an art and a science. These elegant Russian sighthounds carry a lean, athletic build that requires precise nutritional support — not too much, not too little. Their long, narrow frame can make it difficult to gauge body condition at a glance, and their unique physiology (including a notably deep chest and a remarkably fast metabolism when young) means generic feeding advice simply won't cut it.</p>

<h3>Caloric Requirements</h3>
<p>Adult Borzoi typically weigh between 60 and 105 pounds, with males averaging 75–105 lbs and females 60–85 lbs per AKC standards. Despite their large size, many Borzoi have a surprisingly moderate appetite. An average adult Borzoi requires approximately <strong>1,400–2,200 calories per day</strong>, depending on age, activity level, and individual metabolism. Highly active dogs or those engaged in lure coursing may need closer to the upper end of that range, while sedentary house dogs often do well on less.</p>

<h3>Macronutrient Balance</h3>
<p>The Borzoi thrives on a diet rich in high-quality animal protein. Look for foods where a named meat source (chicken, beef, lamb, venison) is the first ingredient. Aim for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Protein:</strong> 22–28% on a dry matter basis for adults; slightly higher for puppies and young dogs still developing muscle</li>
  <li><strong>Fat:</strong> 12–18% — essential for coat health and sustained energy; the Borzoi's famously silky, flowing coat depends heavily on adequate fat intake</li>
  <li><strong>Carbohydrates:</strong> Moderate amounts from digestible sources like brown rice, sweet potato, or oats; avoid fillers like corn syrup or artificial preservatives</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bloat Risk and Dietary Precautions</h3>
<p>This is the single most critical dietary consideration for Borzoi owners. Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus (GDV), commonly called bloat, is a life-threatening condition to which deep-chested breeds like the Borzoi are significantly predisposed. To reduce risk:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feed two or three smaller meals per day rather than one large meal</li>
  <li>Never allow vigorous exercise within 60–90 minutes before or after eating</li>
  <li>Avoid raised feeding bowls unless recommended by your vet for a specific condition (the research on raised bowls and bloat risk is mixed)</li>
  <li>Minimize foods that cause excessive gas production, such as those high in fermentable carbohydrates or soy</li>
  <li>Feed at a calm, slow pace — consider a slow-feeder bowl if your dog tends to gulp food</li>
</ul>

<h3>Life Stage Considerations</h3>
<p>Borzoi puppies grow rapidly and shouldn't be fed a standard adult large-breed formula without consideration. Choose a <strong>large-breed puppy formula</strong> with a controlled calcium-to-phosphorus ratio to support healthy bone development without promoting overly rapid growth, which can stress developing joints. Borzoi are generally considered adults around 18–24 months, though they continue to fill out slightly until age 3.</p>
<p>Senior Borzoi (typically 7 years and older) often benefit from slightly reduced caloric intake and added joint-supporting nutrients like glucosamine and omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil.</p>

<h3>Raw and Fresh Food Diets</h3>
<p>A notable number of Borzoi enthusiasts and serious breeders feed raw or fresh food diets, and many dogs thrive on them. If you choose this route, work with a veterinary nutritionist to ensure the diet is properly balanced. Borzoi on raw diets often show improvements in coat quality and lean muscle maintenance. Commercially prepared raw diets (frozen or freeze-dried) from reputable companies can be a convenient middle ground, typically costing <strong>$100–$250 per month</strong> for a dog of this size.</p>

<h3>Supplements Worth Considering</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Fish oil (omega-3s):</strong> 1,000–3,000 mg EPA/DHA daily for coat and joint health</li>
  <li><strong>Probiotics:</strong> To support digestive health, particularly useful in a breed prone to sensitive stomachs</li>
  <li><strong>Glucosamine/chondroitin:</strong> Beneficial for aging Borzoi or those with heavy exercise histories</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="food-recommendations">
<h2>Best Food Recommendations</h2>

<h3>Feeding the Borzoi: Understanding Their Unique Nutritional Needs</h3>

<p>The Borzoi is a sighthound of extraordinary elegance — a deep-chested, lean-muscled coursing hound that can weigh anywhere from 60 to 105 pounds. Behind that silky, flowing coat lies a dog with a surprisingly sensitive digestive system and a physiology that sets them apart from most other large breeds. Feeding a Borzoi correctly is one of the most important things you can do for their long-term health.</p>

<p>Unlike bulkier large breeds, Borzois carry very little body fat and have a high surface-area-to-mass ratio that makes them prone to temperature sensitivity. More critically, their deep, narrow chest puts them at significant risk for <strong>bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus or GDV)</strong> — one of the leading causes of death in the breed. Diet management is a direct line of defense against this life-threatening condition.</p>

<p>The best food for a Borzoi should meet the following criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Made by a company with board-certified veterinary nutritionists (DACVN) on staff</li>
  <li>Meets AAFCO nutritional adequacy standards through feeding trials, not just formulation</li>
  <li>Lists a named animal protein (chicken, lamb, salmon) as the first ingredient</li>
  <li>Moderate fat content — enough to sustain lean muscle mass without excess weight gain</li>
  <li>Contains omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) to support the Borzoi's luxurious double coat</li>
  <li>Appropriately sized kibble or a wet/raw option to slow eating and reduce bloat risk</li>
  <li>Free from artificial colors, flavors, and cheap fillers that can irritate sensitive Borzoi stomachs</li>
  <li>Low in fermentable carbohydrates that contribute to gas buildup — a serious bloat trigger</li>
</ul>

<p>Always feed a Borzoi two to three small meals per day rather than one large meal. Never exercise them immediately before or after eating, and consider using a slow-feeder bowl. These simple practices can meaningfully reduce bloat risk.</p>

<h3>Best Dry Food (Kibble) for Borzois</h3>

<p>Kibble is practical and effective for most Borzoi owners, provided you choose a formula that respects the breed's sensitive digestion and lean physique. Large-breed adult formulas are typically the best starting point, but avoid overly calorie-dense foods — the Borzoi does not need the same caloric loading as a working breed of similar size.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Royal Canin Giant Adult Dry Dog Food</div>
  <p>Royal Canin's Giant Adult formula is one of the most research-backed large-breed kibbles available, developed with veterinary nutritionists and formulated specifically for the metabolic needs of tall, lean giant breeds like the Borzoi. Its highly digestible protein blend supports the Borzoi's elegant muscle tone without adding excess fat, and the inclusion of EPA and DHA helps maintain the breed's famously silky, flowing coat. The kibble size and texture also encourages slower chewing, which is a small but meaningful step toward reducing bloat risk in this deep-chested breed.</p>

  <p>Hill's Science Diet Large Breed Adult is backed by decades of veterinary research and consistently passes AAFCO feeding trials — not just formulation standards — making it one of the most trustworthy options for sensitive Borzoi owners. The formula features natural chicken as its first ingredient and is carefully balanced to prevent the weight creep that can strain the Borzoi's long, delicate limbs and spine. Its inclusion of glucosamine and chondroitin also provides early joint support for a breed that can develop rear-end weakness as they age.</p>

</div>

<h3>Best Wet Food for Borzois</h3>

<p>Wet food can be an excellent option for Borzois, particularly for dogs with sensitive stomachs, picky appetites, or those who need to slow their eating pace. The higher moisture content also supports kidney health — something worth considering in all sighthound breeds. Wet food can be fed as a complete meal or mixed with kibble to add palatability and hydration.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Purina Pro Plan Savor Adult Wet Dog Food</div>
  <p>Purina Pro Plan's wet formulas are produced under strict quality controls by a company that employs full-time PhD and veterinary nutritionists, making them among the most reliable wet options on the market for sensitive breeds like the Borzoi. The high moisture content aids digestion and hydration — both important for a breed prone to digestive sensitivity — while the soft texture slows consumption naturally and reduces the gulping behavior associated with bloat risk. Its moderate fat profile keeps the Borzoi's characteristically lean silhouette without leaving them under-nourished.</p>

<h3>Best Food for Borzoi Puppies</h3>

<p>Borzoi puppies grow rapidly and reach impressive size, but like all giant breeds, they must not be pushed to grow too fast. Excess calcium and overly high caloric density during puppyhood can lead to skeletal abnormalities, joint problems, and long-term orthopedic damage. Always choose a large-breed or giant-breed puppy formula — never standard puppy food — until your Borzoi reaches 18 to 24 months of age.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Royal Canin Giant Puppy Dry Dog Food</div>
  <p>Royal Canin Giant Puppy is specifically engineered for breeds expected to exceed 70 pounds at maturity, making it an excellent match for growing Borzoi pups whose skeletal development demands precise calcium-to-phosphorus ratios. The controlled energy density prevents the accelerated growth that puts undue stress on a Borzoi puppy's developing joints and spine, while the highly digestible proteins support lean muscle building without overtaxing a puppy's sensitive gastrointestinal tract. This formula also includes antioxidant support to bolster the developing immune system during a Borzoi's long growth window.</p>

<h3>Best Supplement for Borzoi Coat and Joint Health</h3>

<p>Even on a high-quality diet, many Borzoi owners find that targeted supplementation makes a visible difference — particularly for coat quality and joint longevity. The Borzoi's long, silky coat requires consistent omega-3 support, and their lean build can make early joint deterioration more noticeable than in stockier breeds.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Zesty Paws Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Dogs</div>
  <p>Wild Alaskan salmon oil is one of the most effective and bioavailable sources of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids available for dogs, and the Borzoi's spectacular silky coat responds noticeably to consistent supplementation — improving shine, reducing shedding, and supporting skin barrier health. Beyond coat benefits, the anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3s provide meaningful joint support for a breed whose graceful, long-limbed structure can become vulnerable to arthritis and stiffness in later years. Zesty Paws is a widely available, third-party tested option that integrates easily into a Borzoi's daily meal.</p>

<h3>A Final Note on Feeding the Borzoi</h3>

<p>No food recommendation replaces an ongoing relationship with a veterinarian who understands sighthound physiology. Borzois can appear healthy while quietly losing condition due to their low body fat reserves, so regular weight checks and body condition scoring are essential. If your Borzoi shows signs of bloating, food sensitivity, or unexplained weight loss, consult your vet immediately — and always feed smaller, more frequent meals to respect the breed's deep-chested vulnerability. Feed thoughtfully, and this ancient, magnificent hound will thrive.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="feeding-schedule">
<h2>Feeding Schedule</h2>

<p>Establishing a consistent, well-structured feeding schedule for your Borzoi isn't just about convenience — it's a genuine health precaution. Given this breed's elevated risk of bloat and their tendency toward either finicky eating or rapid gulping depending on the individual, routine and portion control are non-negotiable parts of responsible Borzoi ownership.</p>

<h3>Puppy Feeding Schedule (8 Weeks – 6 Months)</h3>
<p>Young Borzoi puppies have small stomachs and high energy demands. Feed <strong>three to four times daily</strong> at evenly spaced intervals. A typical daily portion for a Borzoi puppy at this stage might range from 2 to 4 cups of a high-quality large-breed puppy kibble, divided across meals. Always follow the feeding guide on your specific food as a starting point and adjust based on body condition.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>7:00 AM</strong> — Morning meal</li>
  <li><strong>12:00 PM</strong> — Midday meal</li>
  <li><strong>5:30 PM</strong> — Afternoon meal</li>
  <li><strong>9:00 PM</strong> — Optional small evening meal for very young puppies under 12 weeks</li>
</ul>

<h3>Adolescent Feeding Schedule (6 Months – 18 Months)</h3>
<p>As your Borzoi moves through adolescence — a phase marked by rapid growth and sometimes unpredictable appetite — transition to <strong>two to three meals per day</strong>. Many owners settle on three meals throughout this phase to keep energy steady and reduce bloat risk during this tall, lean growth period. Portion sizes will increase substantially as the dog grows, potentially reaching 4–6 cups of quality kibble daily, depending on the food's caloric density.</p>

<h3>Adult Feeding Schedule (18 Months and Older)</h3>
<p>The cornerstone of adult Borzoi feeding is the <strong>twice-daily schedule</strong>, and most veterinarians and experienced Borzoi breeders strongly advocate for it over once-daily feeding. Two meals reduce the volume of food in the stomach at any one time, which is one of the simplest and most effective ways to lower bloat risk.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>7:00–8:00 AM</strong> — Morning meal (roughly half of daily ration)</li>
  <li><strong>5:00–6:00 PM</strong> — Evening meal (remaining half of daily ration)</li>
</ul>
<p>A typical adult Borzoi may eat anywhere from <strong>3 to 6 cups of quality dry kibble per day</strong>, split between two meals. Active dogs and males consistently need more; smaller females and less active dogs may need less. Always let body condition — not just the clock or the bag's guidelines — be your guide.</p>

<h3>The Exercise Window: A Non-Negotiable Rule</h3>
<p>Perhaps more than any other scheduling consideration, the exercise buffer around mealtimes is critical for Borzoi. Follow this rule consistently:</p>
<ul>
  <li>No vigorous exercise for at least <strong>60–90 minutes before</strong> feeding</li>
  <li>No vigorous exercise for at least <strong>60–90 minutes after</strong> feeding</li>
  <li>Calm, on-leash walks for bathroom purposes are generally acceptable</li>
  <li>This is especially important after lure coursing, running, or any intense play session</li>
</ul>
<p>This timing rule should be communicated clearly to all family members, dog sitters, and anyone who cares for your Borzoi.</p>

<h3>Monitoring Body Condition</h3>
<p>Borzoi are naturally lean and their ribs should be easily felt — but not starkly visible — under a thin layer of muscle and fat. Their hip bones and spine may be slightly visible, which is normal for the breed. What you're watching for is the classic Borzoi tuck at the abdomen. Use this general guideline:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Too thin:</strong> Ribs, spine, and hip bones clearly visible with no padding; skin lacks elasticity</li>
  <li><strong>Ideal:</strong> Ribs easily felt with light pressure but not visually prominent; visible waist from above; tucked abdomen from the side</li>
  <li><strong>Too heavy:</strong> Ribs difficult to feel; little to no waist definition; abdomen no longer tucked</li>
</ul>
<p>Weigh your Borzoi monthly if possible. Many veterinary clinics allow free weight checks, and keeping a simple log helps you catch gradual changes before they become a problem.</p>

<h3>Water Access</h3>
<p>Fresh, clean water should be available at all times — but avoid allowing your Borzoi to drink large quantities immediately before or after meals. Moderate water intake around feeding time is fine; gulping large volumes on a full stomach may contribute to bloat risk. Some owners slightly limit water access for 30 minutes post-meal, though this should be done carefully in warm weather.</p>

<h3>Feeding Costs</h3>
<p>Budget approximately <strong>$60–$120 per month</strong> for a high-quality commercial dry kibble for an adult Borzoi. Premium or prescription diets may run $120–$180 monthly. Raw or fresh food diets typically cost $150–$300 per month for a dog of this size. Factoring in occasional treats and supplements, most Borzoi owners spend <strong>$75–$200 per month</strong> on food-related expenses.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="food-bowls">
<h2>Food Bowls & Accessories</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is a study in elegant contradictions — a giant, deep-chested sighthound with the appetite of a moderate-sized dog and the physical vulnerabilities of a much larger breed. Feeding a Borzoi correctly isn't just about what goes in the bowl; it's about <em>how</em> it gets there. This breed is at significant risk for <strong>bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus or GDV)</strong>, a life-threatening condition where the stomach twists after rapid eating or drinking. Their long, narrow heads, arched necks, and deep chests also create ergonomic challenges that most standard dog bowls simply weren't designed to address.</p>

<p>Choosing the right feeding setup for a Borzoi means thinking carefully about bowl depth, eating speed, portion timing, and neck posture. The following recommendations address each of these concerns with gear specifically suited to this graceful, sensitive breed.</p>

<h3>Slow Feeders & Bloat Prevention</h3>

<p>Bloat prevention is arguably the most important feeding consideration for any Borzoi owner. This breed should never eat large meals quickly, and mealtime should always be calm and unhurried. A slow feeder insert or bowl can dramatically reduce the speed at which your Borzoi inhales food, lowering the risk of GDV. Always wait at least 60–90 minutes before and after meals before allowing vigorous exercise.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Outward Hound Fun Feeder Slow Bowl – Large</div>
  <p>The maze-like ridges inside this slow feeder force a Borzoi to work around obstacles to access kibble, extending a meal that might otherwise be inhaled in seconds to a safer, measured pace. For a deep-chested breed with a documented GDV risk, this simple intervention can be genuinely life-saving. The large size accommodates the Borzoi's long, narrow muzzle without causing frustration or food avoidance.</p>

  <p>The LickiMat Wobble's textured, dome-shaped surface is ideal for serving wet food, raw food, or food toppers to a Borzoi in a way that naturally slows consumption. Licking is a naturally calming behavior that also reduces mealtime stress and gulping — both important for this anxious, sensitive breed. Its weighted base keeps it stable even when nudged by a long Borzoi snout.</p>

</div>

<h3>Elevated Feeders for Neck & Posture Support</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's dramatically arched neck and long legs mean that bending all the way to the floor to eat is an unnatural and potentially uncomfortable position. An elevated feeder brings the bowl up to a more ergonomic height, reducing strain on the neck and spine. However, it's worth noting that the research on elevated feeders and bloat risk is mixed — they are recommended here primarily for <em>comfort and posture</em> rather than as a bloat prevention measure. Always pair an elevated feeder with a slow feeder bowl insert.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: IRIS USA Elevated Feeder with Storage – Large/Extra Large</div>
  <p>This elevated feeding station raises food and water bowls to a comfortable height for a tall breed like the Borzoi, whose shoulder height typically ranges from 26 to 32 inches. The built-in storage compartment beneath the stand is a practical bonus for keeping a bag of kibble dust-free and close at hand. The included stainless steel bowls are easy to sanitize, resist bacteria, and don't harbor the odors that can put a sensitive Borzoi off their food.</p>

</div>

<h3>Water Bowls & Hydration</h3>

<p>Borzois can be surprisingly particular about their water. Their long, silky ear feathering and facial furnishings mean that a wide, deep water bowl will constantly soak their ears — leading to irritation and potential ear infections. A narrower, taller water bowl keeps the coat dry while still allowing comfortable drinking access for their long muzzle.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Spaniel Smart Bowl – No-Mess Deep Muzzle Water Bowl</div>
  <p>Originally designed for long-eared spaniels, this narrow, deep-walled bowl works beautifully for Borzois whose flowing ear feathering drags into standard wide bowls. The tall walls keep ear furnishings dry and clean while the depth accommodates the Borzoi's distinctively long, tapered muzzle without restriction. Keeping the ears dry at mealtime is a small but meaningful step in preventing chronic moisture-related irritation for this heavily coated breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>Portion Control & Feeding Routine Accessories</h3>

<p>Because Borzois should be fed two to three small meals per day rather than one large meal — and because meal size, consistency, and timing genuinely matter for GDV risk management — having the right measuring and storage tools is more than just convenience for this breed.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: OXO Good Grips Stainless Steel Food Scoop with Clip</div>
  <p>Precise portion control is essential for a breed prone to bloat, and eyeballing kibble quantities is a habit Borzoi owners should avoid. This OXO scoop doubles as a bag clip, keeping food fresh between the two or three measured daily meals your Borzoi should receive. Consistent portion sizes also help you quickly notice if your Borzoi's appetite changes — which in a naturally lean breed can be an early sign of illness.</p>

</div>

<h3>Key Takeaways for Borzoi Feeding Setups</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Always use a slow feeder</strong> — rapid eating is a primary GDV trigger in deep-chested breeds like the Borzoi.</li>
  <li><strong>Feed two to three small meals daily</strong> rather than one large meal to further reduce bloat risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Choose a narrow water bowl</strong> to keep the Borzoi's long ear feathering and facial coat dry and healthy.</li>
  <li><strong>Elevate bowls for comfort</strong> — a dog this tall should not have to strain downward at every meal, though elevation alone will not prevent bloat.</li>
  <li><strong>No exercise 60–90 minutes before or after eating</strong> — enforce this rule consistently from puppyhood.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep mealtime calm</strong> — the Borzoi is a sensitive breed that can become anxious and eat erratically under stressful conditions.</li>
</ul>

<section class="chapter" id="training">
<h2>Training Basics</h2>

<p>Training a Borzoi is a uniquely rewarding experience — provided you approach it with patience, creativity, and a healthy respect for what this breed was built to do. Developed in Russia over centuries to course wolves across open terrain independently, the Borzoi is intelligent but operates with a remarkable degree of autonomy. They are not Golden Retrievers who live to please; they are more akin to cats in canine form — capable, thoughtful, and selectively cooperative.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Borzoi Mind</h3>
<p>The Borzoi is often described as "cat-like" in temperament, and nowhere is this more evident than in training. These dogs are highly intelligent and learn quickly — but they may choose not to perform if the motivation isn't there or if the exercise feels repetitive and pointless to them. This is not stubbornness in the traditional sense; it is the behavior of a dog bred to think and act independently in the field. Adjust your expectations accordingly and you'll find a surprisingly capable training partner.</p>

<h3>Positive Reinforcement Is Essential</h3>
<p>Harsh corrections, repetitive drilling, and punishment-based methods are particularly counterproductive with Borzoi. These are sensitive dogs — emotionally and physically — and a single harsh correction can damage trust that takes weeks to rebuild. Positive reinforcement with high-value rewards (small pieces of real meat, chicken, or cheese work well) and genuine enthusiasm from the handler produces far better results than any compulsive technique.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Keep training sessions short: <strong>5–10 minutes maximum</strong> for focused work; Borzoi lose interest quickly</li>
  <li>End every session on a success, even if it means returning to a command the dog knows well</li>
  <li>Vary the routine — Borzoi become bored with exact repetition more quickly than most breeds</li>
  <li>Use a calm, confident voice; Borzoi are sensitive to tone and respond poorly to frustration</li>
</ul>

<h3>Basic Obedience Priorities</h3>
<p>Focus first on the commands that directly impact safety and daily life. For a Borzoi, these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Sit and Down:</strong> Foundation commands that establish communication; most Borzoi learn these within 1–2 weeks of consistent practice</li>
  <li><strong>Stay:</strong> Particularly important for safety in and around vehicles and near roads</li>
  <li><strong>Leave it:</strong> Essential for a dog with a high prey drive who may fixate on small animals</li>
  <li><strong>Name recognition and recall:</strong> The recall is arguably the most important skill for a sighthound — and also the most challenging. Begin recall training early and reinforce it heavily throughout the dog's life. Never consider a Borzoi's recall reliable enough to be off-leash in an unfenced area</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Recall Reality</h3>
<p>No chapter on Borzoi training would be complete without addressing this honestly: the Borzoi recall is inherently unreliable in open, unfenced spaces. When this breed locks onto a moving target — a squirrel, a rabbit, a distant jogger — centuries of genetic programming take over and no amount of training reliably overrides it. Experienced Borzoi owners accept this and plan accordingly: fenced yards, long-line training, and leash walks in open areas are standard practice. This isn't a training failure; it's the breed.</p>

<h3>Leash Manners</h3>
<p>Borzoi are large, powerful dogs capable of easily pulling an adult off their feet — especially when they spot prey. Loose-leash walking should be introduced early with a properly fitted martingale collar or a front-clip harness. Avoid retractable leashes, which offer insufficient control for a dog that can reach speeds of <strong>35–40 mph</strong> in a burst.</p>

<h3>Socialization</h3>
<p>Early and broad socialization is critical. Borzoi can be reserved and aloof with strangers, and without positive early exposure they may become excessively shy or reactive. Aim to expose puppies to a wide variety of people, dogs, sounds, and environments between <strong>8 and 16 weeks</strong> of age. Puppy classes offer both socialization and early obedience foundations, and most well-run classes are excellent environments for young Borzoi.</p>
<p>Note that Borzoi should be introduced carefully to small dogs and cats given their prey drive. Many Borzoi coexist peacefully with cats they were raised with, but introductions with unknown small animals should always be supervised.</p>

<h3>Advanced Activities</h3>
<p>Borzoi who have mastered basics often excel in activities that tap into their natural gifts. <strong>Lure coursing</strong> — sanctioned by the AKC — is the most natural fit and deeply satisfying for the breed. Some Borzoi also enjoy rally obedience, canine freestyle, and even therapy work given their elegant appearance and gentle nature. Agility is possible but less common due to the breed's independent nature and long legs.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="behavior">
<h2>Common Behavioral Issues</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is generally a composed, gentle, and elegant companion — not a breed prone to aggression, excessive barking, or destructive outbursts in the way some working breeds can be. However, like every breed, they come with characteristic behavioral tendencies that can become problematic without proper management and understanding. Most Borzoi behavioral issues stem from one of three sources: unmet instinctual needs, insufficient early socialization, or a mismatch of expectations between owner and dog.</p>

<h3>Prey Drive and Chasing</h3>
<p>This is, without question, the most significant behavioral consideration for Borzoi owners. The prey drive in this breed is ancient, powerful, and deeply hardwired. Borzoi will chase — squirrels, rabbits, cats, small dogs, blowing leaves, and occasionally joggers or cyclists. This behavior is not a problem with the individual dog; it is a fundamental characteristic of the breed.</p>
<p>The risks are real: a Borzoi in pursuit is essentially deaf to commands and unaware of traffic or other hazards. Management strategies include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Always leashing in unfenced areas — no exceptions</li>
  <li>Ensuring fences are at least <strong>5–6 feet tall</strong> and secure at the base (Borzoi are not typically diggers, but they are exceptional jumpers)</li>
  <li>Using a long line (15–30 feet) for exercise in open spaces</li>
  <li>Channeling prey drive positively through lure coursing or other structured chase activities</li>
</ul>

<h3>Aloofness and Shyness with Strangers</h3>
<p>Borzoi are not naturally gregarious with people they don't know. They tend to be reserved, sometimes intensely so, and may appear cold or even anxious in the presence of unfamiliar people or chaotic environments. This is a breed trait, not a behavioral disorder — but without adequate socialization during puppyhood, it can tip into genuine shyness or fear-based behavior.</p>
<p>Signs that shyness has become a problem include trembling, cowering, attempting to flee, or snapping when approached by strangers. If this occurs, work with a positive reinforcement trainer or veterinary behaviorist. Forcing a shy Borzoi into interactions they're not ready for typically makes the issue worse, not better.</p>

<h3>Separation Anxiety</h3>
<p>Despite their independent nature, Borzoi form strong bonds with their family and do not enjoy being left alone for long periods. Some Borzoi develop separation anxiety manifesting as pacing, whining, destructive behavior (particularly chewing), or house-soiling when left alone. Borzoi do best in homes where someone is present for the majority of the day, or where they have the company of another dog.</p>
<p>If separation anxiety is a concern, gradual desensitization to departures, providing enrichment toys (stuffed Kongs, puzzle feeders), and crate training introduced positively from puppyhood can all help significantly.</p>

<h3>Destructive Behavior in Adolescence</h3>
<p>Borzoi adolescence — roughly <strong>6 to 18 months</strong> — can be a challenging period. Teenage Borzoi may become more energetic, mouthy, and prone to chewing or getting into things they previously ignored. This phase passes, but requires consistent management: providing appropriate chew outlets (bully sticks, raw bones, durable toys), ensuring adequate daily exercise (at least <strong>45–60 minutes</strong>), and continuing positive training through this phase.</p>

<h3>Selective Hearing and Stubbornness</h3>
<p>As discussed in training, Borzoi operate with a degree of independence that can read as stubbornness. Owners who expect the instant compliance common in highly biddable breeds often interpret the Borzoi's thoughtful, evaluating pause before responding as defiance. It isn't — it's just the breed. The solution is not firmer correction but smarter training: better motivators, shorter sessions, more interesting exercises, and a genuine sense of humor about the Borzoi's charming selective cooperation.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity to Household Stress</h3>
<p>Borzoi are emotionally sensitive dogs who pick up on tension, loud arguments, and chaotic household environments more acutely than many breeds. A chronically stressed household may produce a Borzoi who is anxious, withdrawn, or exhibits stress-related behaviors like over-grooming, digestive upset, or loss of appetite. This is a dog that flourishes in a calm, consistent, affectionate home environment.</p>

<h3>Coexistence with Small Animals</h3>
<p>Borzoi can absolutely live with cats and small dogs — many do happily — but this coexistence requires early introduction and ongoing supervision. A Borzoi who was raised with a cat from puppyhood will typically regard that cat as part of its pack. The same dog may view an unknown cat outdoors as prey. Never assume that because a Borzoi is safe with your cat indoors, that behavior will generalize to all small animals in all contexts.</p>
<p>Introduce any new small animals carefully, on leash, with controlled, positive interactions over multiple sessions before allowing unsupervised contact.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="socialization">
<h2>Borzoi Socialization Guide</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is a breed that carries centuries of aristocratic breeding in its elegant frame — and that heritage shows in its temperament. Naturally reserved, quietly dignified, and selectively affectionate, the Borzoi is not a dog that warms to strangers on command. Thoughtful, early socialization is essential to raising a Borzoi that is confident and adaptable rather than aloof, anxious, or reactive.</p>

<h3>The Borzoi Temperament Baseline</h3>
<p>Before diving into socialization tactics, it helps to understand what you're working with. Borzoi are sighthounds — a category of dog bred for independent thinking, speed, and prey drive rather than close collaboration with humans. They are sensitive, emotionally perceptive dogs that do not respond well to harsh handling or chaotic environments. Most Borzoi will never become the boisterously social dog that greets every stranger like a long-lost friend, and that's completely normal. The goal of socialization is not to change their character but to ensure they can navigate the modern world calmly and without fear.</p>

<h3>The Critical Window: 3 to 14 Weeks</h3>
<p>Like all dogs, the Borzoi's most important socialization window runs from approximately 3 to 14 weeks of age. Responsible breeders will have already begun this process before a puppy ever arrives in your home, introducing littermates to a variety of textures, sounds, people, and gentle handling. When you bring your Borzoi puppy home — typically around 8 to 10 weeks — you are continuing work that has already begun, not starting from scratch.</p>

<p>During these early weeks, aim to expose your puppy to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>People of varying ages, appearances, and energy levels — including children, elderly individuals, and people wearing hats or uniforms</li>
  <li>Household sounds such as vacuums, televisions, doorbells, and kitchen appliances</li>
  <li>Different flooring surfaces (hardwood, tile, carpet, grass, gravel)</li>
  <li>Car rides, crates, and veterinary handling</li>
  <li>Other dogs of various sizes and temperaments in controlled settings</li>
</ul>

<h3>Socializing With Other Dogs and Animals</h3>
<p>Borzoi typically get along well with other Borzoi and similarly sized dogs. Their sighthound heritage, however, means that small animals — including cats, rabbits, and small dogs — can trigger a strong prey drive. Socialization with smaller animals should begin early and always be supervised. Many Borzoi can live peacefully with household cats they have been raised with, but they should never be trusted off-leash around unknown small animals. Introductions to other dogs should be done in neutral territory with calm, confident animals rather than boisterous, unpredictable puppies.</p>

<h3>Meeting Strangers: Managing the Reserve</h3>
<p>Borzoi are not naturally gregarious with strangers, and forcing interactions can backfire badly, creating anxiety rather than confidence. Instead, allow your Borzoi to approach new people on their own terms. Ask visitors to crouch down, avoid direct eye contact, and offer a treat without reaching overhead. Consistent positive experiences — never forced ones — build the association that strangers predict good things rather than discomfort.</p>

<p>Expose adolescent and adult Borzoi regularly to public outings: pet-friendly stores, outdoor café patios, parks, and neighborhood walks where they encounter new people and stimuli on a routine basis. A Borzoi that only experiences their home environment will become more, not less, sensitive over time.</p>

<h3>Children and Family Dynamics</h3>
<p>Borzoi can be wonderful family dogs, but their sensitivity and physical fragility as puppies (those long legs and slender frames are more delicate than they look) make them better suited to families with older, calmer children. Toddlers who grab, shriek, and move unpredictably can overwhelm a Borzoi. Always supervise interactions between Borzoi and young children, and teach children to respect the dog's space and signals.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Socialization for Adult Dogs</h3>
<p>Socialization is not a puppy-only project. Adult Borzoi who lose regular exposure to new people and environments can regress toward shyness and reactivity. Maintain a routine of varied outings throughout your dog's life. If you adopt a rescue Borzoi with an unknown history, move slowly, build trust through predictable routines, and consult a positive-reinforcement trainer experienced with sighthounds — they respond very differently than herding or sporting breeds.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="training-tools">
<h2>Recommended Training Tools</h2>

<h3>Training the Borzoi: What You're Working With</h3>

<p>The Borzoi is one of the most misunderstood breeds when it comes to training. As a sighthound developed over centuries in Russia to hunt wolves independently across vast open terrain, the Borzoi is not wired for eager, immediate compliance the way a Border Collie or Labrador might be. These dogs are extraordinarily intelligent — but that intelligence comes paired with an independent, almost cat-like disposition. They assess instructions, weigh their options, and decide whether cooperation seems worthwhile.</p>

<p>What this means in practice is that heavy-handed correction-based training will backfire badly with a Borzoi. They are sensitive dogs with long memories and thin skin — a harsh correction can set back weeks of trust-building in a single session. What works instead is positive reinforcement delivered with impeccable timing, short sessions that respect the breed's low boredom threshold, and a trainer (human or tool) that makes compliance feel like the dog's own idea.</p>

<p>The physical characteristics of the Borzoi also shape your tool choices. Their long, narrow skull makes standard collars a poor fit for leash work — they can back out of a flat collar in seconds. Their deep chest and lean frame mean harnesses must be fitted with care. And their explosive sighthound sprint — capable of 35–40 mph — means recall training and secure containment are genuinely life-or-death priorities.</p>

<p>The following tools are specifically chosen for the Borzoi's unique temperament, anatomy, and training challenges.</p>

<h3>Collar and Leash Control</h3>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Martingale Collar for Large Dogs</div>
  <p>The Borzoi's narrow, elegant head is famously smaller in circumference than their neck, making a standard flat collar a serious escape risk the moment they catch a scent and bolt. A martingale collar solves this by tightening to a safe, preset limit under tension — preventing slip-outs without the harsh choking action of a prong or choke chain, which would be entirely inappropriate for this sensitive breed. Look for a wide, padded version in a size suited to sighthound neck measurements.</p>

    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: No-Pull Step-In Harness for Large Dogs</div>
  <p>For Borzois who lunge after visual stimuli — a squirrel, a cyclist, a blowing leaf — a properly fitted step-in harness distributes pressure across the chest rather than concentrating it on the delicate neck and trachea of this long-throated breed. The step-in style is especially practical for sighthounds because it avoids pulling anything over that long, narrow skull. Choose a harness with adjustable girth straps and a front clip attachment point to help redirect the dog's momentum back toward you during leash training.</p>

<h3>Positive Reinforcement Tools</h3>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Clicker Training Kit with Wrist Strap</div>
  <p>Because Borzois respond best to precise, well-timed positive reinforcement rather than repeated verbal commands, a clicker is an ideal training tool for this breed. The sharp, consistent sound of a click marks the exact moment of correct behavior far more accurately than the human voice — critical when working with a dog that can decide a half-second of delay means the rules have changed. A kit that includes a wrist strap keeps the clicker ready during the short, frequent sessions this breed thrives on without requiring you to juggle multiple items.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Freeze-Dried Meat Training Treats (Small Pieces)</div>
  <p>Borzois are not food-obsessed dogs by default, which means low-value treats like commercial kibble biscuits will often fail to hold their attention during training. High-value, aromatic freeze-dried meat treats — beef liver, chicken, or salmon — are far more likely to engage a Borzoi's interest and keep them motivated through a session. Keep pieces very small (pea-sized) to avoid filling them up quickly, since this lean breed has a sensitive stomach and overfeeding mid-session can cause both disinterest and digestive upset.</p>

<h3>Recall and Off-Leash Safety</h3>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Long Training Leash 30–50 Foot</div>
  <p>Recall training is one of the most critical — and most challenging — skills to build with a Borzoi. Once this breed locks onto a visual target, their prey drive overrides nearly everything else, making a solid off-leash recall genuinely difficult to achieve in unsecured areas. A long line of 30–50 feet allows you to practice and reinforce recall commands at real distances while maintaining a physical safety net, giving the dog a taste of the freedom they crave while you build the trust and reinforcement history needed for reliable off-leash response. Choose a lightweight biothane or nylon version that won't tangle in long Borzoi leg feathering.</p>

<h3>Mental Enrichment and Focus</h3>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Snuffle Mat for Dogs</div>
  <p>A Borzoi that is mentally understimulated between training sessions will become disengaged, aloof, and increasingly difficult to motivate when you do want to train. Snuffle mats tap into this breed's acute nose — often underestimated in sighthounds — and provide calm, rewarding mental work that builds the dog's general association between engagement with humans and positive outcomes. Incorporating a snuffle mat into your daily routine also helps settle a Borzoi's naturally restless, stimulus-seeking temperament, making formal training sessions easier to start and sustain.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Final Note on Borzoi Training</h3>

<p>The right tools will take you a long way with a Borzoi — but no tool replaces patience and a willingness to meet this breed on its own terms. Sessions should be kept to five to ten minutes maximum, should always end on a success, and should never involve punishment-based methods. The Borzoi that trusts you is a graceful, willing, and surprisingly capable training partner. The Borzoi that doesn't trust you simply won't play at all.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Always use a martingale or secure harness — never rely on a flat collar alone</li>
  <li>Keep sessions short, positive, and varied to hold attention</li>
  <li>Use the highest-value treats you can find to compete with environmental distractions</li>
  <li>Never practice off-leash recall in unsecured areas until reliability is rock-solid</li>
  <li>Build trust first — compliance will follow</li>
</ul>

<h2>Borzoi Exercise Requirements</h2>

<p>The Borzoi is a dog of breathtaking speed and surprising calm — a combination that often confuses new owners. These are not hyperactive, demand-barking dogs that will destroy furniture without a five-mile run. They are, at their core, sprinters: dogs built for explosive bursts of speed rather than sustained athletic endurance. Understanding this distinction is the key to meeting their exercise needs appropriately without overworking or underworking them.</p>

<h3>How Much Exercise Does a Borzoi Need?</h3>
<p>Adult Borzoi (ages 2 and up) typically require approximately <strong>45 to 60 minutes of exercise per day</strong>, ideally split across two sessions. This should include at least one session of free running in a fully enclosed, secure space — not on-leash walking alone. On-leash walks are valuable for mental stimulation and routine, but they do not adequately satisfy a Borzoi's need for speed. A dog that never has the opportunity to run freely will often become restless, anxious, or destructive indoors.</p>

<p>That said, Borzoi are famously content couch companions when their exercise needs are met. Many owners describe them as "45 minutes of crazy followed by 23 hours of napping," and that's not far from the truth.</p>

<h3>The Puppy Caveat: Less Is More</h3>
<p>Borzoi puppies are among the fastest-growing large breeds — males can reach 75 to 105 pounds and females 60 to 85 pounds at maturity — and their skeletal development continues until roughly 18 to 24 months of age. During this period, excessive forced exercise (long runs, repetitive jumping, hard surfaces) can cause lasting damage to developing joints and growth plates.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>8–16 weeks:</strong> Short, free play sessions of 5–10 minutes; no forced exercise</li>
  <li><strong>4–6 months:</strong> 15–20 minute leash walks plus supervised free play on soft surfaces</li>
  <li><strong>6–12 months:</strong> Gradually increase to 30 minutes; avoid prolonged running on hard surfaces</li>
  <li><strong>12–18 months:</strong> Begin transitioning to adult exercise routines slowly</li>
  <li><strong>18–24 months:</strong> Full adult exercise routine once skeletal maturity is confirmed</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Importance of a Secure Space</h3>
<p>This cannot be overstated: <strong>Borzoi should never be exercised off-leash in an unenclosed area.</strong> A Borzoi that spots a squirrel, rabbit, or bicycle a quarter-mile away can reach speeds of 35 to 40 mph within seconds and will be completely unreachable by voice recall. A fence of at least 5 to 6 feet is essential — ideally 6 feet, as athletic Borzoi can clear lower barriers. Underground electronic fencing is not a safe option for this breed; the prey drive overrides the correction impulse entirely.</p>

<h3>On-Leash Walking: Mental Exercise Matters Too</h3>
<p>Daily leash walks of 20 to 30 minutes serve an important purpose beyond physical conditioning. Sniffing, observing, and exploring novel environments provide critical mental stimulation that a fenced yard sprint cannot replace. Vary your walking routes regularly, and allow your Borzoi plenty of time to sniff — they are sighthounds, but their noses are still far more capable than any human's, and scent investigation is genuinely tiring in a positive way.</p>

<h3>Senior Borzoi Exercise Needs</h3>
<p>Borzoi typically live 9 to 14 years, and senior dogs (generally 8 years and older) require adjusted exercise routines. Shorter, more frequent walks of 15 to 20 minutes replace long runs. Watch for signs of stiffness, reluctance to rise, or reduced enthusiasm for activity, as Borzoi are prone to musculoskeletal issues in their senior years. Low-impact activities like gentle leash walks and controlled free movement on soft grass remain appropriate well into old age.</p>

<h3>Exercise and Bloat Risk</h3>
<p>As a deep-chested breed, Borzoi are at elevated risk for gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), commonly known as bloat. Never exercise your Borzoi vigorously for at least one hour before or after meals. Many owners feed two smaller meals per day rather than one large meal to help mitigate this risk — a practice strongly recommended by most Borzoi-specialist veterinarians and breeders.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="activities">
<h2>Best Activities for Borzoi</h2>

<p>Borzoi are athletes disguised as living sculptures. Beneath that silky, flowing coat and calm, aristocratic bearing lies a dog purpose-built for performance — specifically, the pursuit of prey at extreme speed across open terrain. The best activities for a Borzoi are those that honor this heritage while fitting into the realities of modern pet ownership. The good news is that Borzoi are remarkably versatile for a sighthound, and there are more options than most owners initially realize.</p>

<h3>Lure Coursing: The Gold Standard</h3>
<p>If there is one activity that every Borzoi should experience, it is lure coursing. Sanctioned by the AKC and the American Sighthound Field Association (ASFA), lure coursing involves chasing a mechanically operated lure — typically a white plastic bag — across an open field in a pattern that mimics the unpredictable movement of live prey. For a Borzoi, this activity is nothing short of transformative. Eyes light up, the body shifts into a different gear entirely, and the dog becomes something extraordinary to watch.</p>

<p>The AKC offers both competitive lure coursing titles and the CAT (Coursing Ability Test) and BCAT (Basic Coursing Ability Test) for owners who want a more casual entry point. Entry fees typically range from <strong>$20 to $40 per run</strong>. No prior training is required — most Borzoi need only see the lure move once before instinct takes over completely.</p>

<h3>Straight Racing</h3>
<p>Straight racing on an oval or straight track is another sighthound staple that Borzoi excel at, though it is less widely available than lure coursing. The National Oval Track Racing Association (NOTRA) and Large Gazehound Racing Association (LGRA) host events specifically for larger sighthound breeds. Racing is highly social for owners — the Borzoi community is passionate and welcoming — and events are wonderful opportunities to meet other breed enthusiasts.</p>

<h3>Fast CAT (Coursing Ability Test)</h3>
<p>Fast CAT is an AKC event that involves a single dog running a straight 100-yard dash after a lure. It is one of the most accessible sighthound activities available, requiring no training and minimal equipment, and Borzoi are among the fastest competitors in their weight class. The AKC records official times and assigns points based on speed relative to the dog's height, allowing owners to track progress and earn titles. This is an excellent starting point for owners new to performance events.</p>

<h3>Agility: Modified and Gentle</h3>
<p>Borzoi can participate in agility, though they approach it with the independent thinking characteristic of sighthounds — meaning they may complete an obstacle course in their own order and on their own schedule. For owners who enjoy the sport, agility provides excellent mental and physical stimulation. Keep sessions short (10 to 15 minutes maximum), use high-value rewards, and maintain a sense of humor. A Borzoi doing agility on its own terms is still a Borzoi doing agility.</p>

<h3>Canine Freestyle and Obedience</h3>
<p>While not a breed famous for competitive obedience, Borzoi are more trainable than their reputation suggests when positive reinforcement is used consistently. Canine freestyle (dancing with your dog) can be a beautiful showcase for the Borzoi's natural grace and fluid movement. Basic obedience titles through the AKC — such as the Canine Good Citizen (CGC) certification — are realistic and rewarding goals for most Borzoi owners.</p>

<h3>Hiking and Trail Running</h3>
<p>For outdoor-oriented owners, Borzoi make excellent hiking companions on leash once they reach skeletal maturity (around 18 to 24 months). Their long, efficient stride covers ground effortlessly, and they tend to enjoy the environmental enrichment of varied terrain. Always use a secure, well-fitted martingale collar or a combination of collar and harness — a Borzoi's narrow head can slip standard buckle collars with ease. Trail running is best reserved for adults on soft terrain to protect those elegant joints.</p>

<h3>Simply Running in a Secure Yard</h3>
<p>Never underestimate the value of a good, large, fenced yard for a Borzoi. Zoomies — those exuberant, full-speed circuits that Borzoi spontaneously launch into — are pure joy to watch and genuinely satisfy their need for speed without requiring any scheduling or equipment. A yard of at least 50 by 100 feet gives a Borzoi room to truly open up. Pair yard time with another activity for a complete exercise program.</p>

<h2>Borzoi Indoor vs. Outdoor Needs</h2>

<p>One of the most common misconceptions about Borzoi is that, because they are large and fast, they must need vast amounts of outdoor space and constant activity to be happy. In reality, the Borzoi is one of the more apartment-adaptable large breeds — provided their exercise needs are met through intentional daily activity. What they emphatically are not is outdoor-only dogs. These are dogs that belong inside, close to their people, preferably on the most comfortable available surface.</p>

<h3>Indoor Living: The Borzoi in the Home</h3>
<p>The Borzoi is a devoted companion with a strong preference for human proximity. They follow their owners from room to room with quiet attentiveness, sprawl across sofas with the boneless abandon of a cat, and generally settle into household routines with surprising ease. Their relatively low indoor energy (once adequately exercised) makes them manageable even in larger apartments, though a home with at least moderate square footage is more comfortable for a dog that can span 5 to 6 feet from nose to tail tip when fully extended on the floor.</p>

<p>Key indoor considerations for Borzoi include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Soft resting surfaces:</strong> Borzoi have very little body fat and minimal padding over their bony prominences. Hard floors are uncomfortable and can cause pressure sores over time. Provide at least one large, well-cushioned orthopedic bed (expect to spend <strong>$60 to $150</strong> for an appropriately sized bed). Most Borzoi will also happily claim the sofa — a decision best made deliberately rather than accidentally.</li>
  <li><strong>Temperature sensitivity:</strong> With their single-layer, silky coat, Borzoi are surprisingly sensitive to cold, despite their Russian origins. Indoor temperatures below 65°F can make them visibly uncomfortable. They do not thrive in cold, drafty homes without supplemental warmth.</li>
  <li><strong>Space to stretch:</strong> While Borzoi are calm indoors, they do occasionally experience spontaneous bursts of energy. A home with some open floor space — or a safely fenced yard attached — allows them to move freely without toppling furniture or people.</li>
  <li><strong>Height awareness:</strong> Borzoi are tall dogs whose tails and rear ends are approximately counter height. Tails are long and whip-like and will clear coffee tables of their contents at remarkable speed. Baby-proof fragile items at counter height and below.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outdoor Requirements: Space and Security</h3>
<p>While Borzoi are indoor dogs at heart, their outdoor environment must be thoughtfully managed. A securely fenced yard is the gold standard — ideally a minimum of 5,000 to 6,000 square feet of enclosed space, with fencing no shorter than 5 to 6 feet. Standard picket or split-rail fencing is not sufficient. Privacy fencing, chain-link, or solid wooden panel fencing at appropriate height are all suitable options.</p>

<p>Borzoi should never be left outdoors unsupervised for extended periods, for several reasons:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Their prey drive makes them escape artists when wildlife is spotted — a determined Borzoi can clear or dig under inadequate fencing</li>
  <li>They are sensitive to weather extremes; prolonged exposure to temperatures below 40°F or above 85°F is inappropriate</li>
  <li>Their sensitive temperament makes isolation stressful — they are not dogs that do well being left alone in a backyard</li>
  <li>Their single coat provides limited protection from rain, wind, and cold compared to double-coated breeds</li>
</ul>

<h3>Can a Borzoi Live in an Apartment?</h3>
<p>Yes — with important caveats. A Borzoi in an apartment requires a committed owner who will provide daily off-leash exercise in a secure location (a dog park with large-dog sections, a fenced sports field, or a lure coursing venue), two to three leash walks daily, and consistent enrichment indoors. The breed's low-key indoor temperament works in their favor. An apartment Borzoi who gets adequate exercise is often less destructive than a Labrador in a house who doesn't.</p>

<h3>Weather and Seasonal Adjustments</h3>
<p>During winter months, particularly in climates with sustained sub-freezing temperatures, many Borzoi benefit from a well-fitted dog coat for outdoor time. Their lean body composition and minimal coat insulation make them genuinely cold in harsh weather. In summer, exercise should be scheduled during cooler morning and evening hours — Borzoi overheat more easily than double-coated breeds, and hot pavement can damage their paws. Fresh water and shaded outdoor spaces are essential in warm months.</p>

<h3>The Ideal Living Situation</h3>
<p>The ideal home for a Borzoi combines a comfortable, temperature-controlled indoor environment where the dog is fully integrated into family life, with reliable access to a large, securely fenced outdoor space for daily running. A suburban home with a well-fenced backyard of at least 3,000 to 5,000 square feet, combined with regular off-property exercise, represents the sweet spot. Rural properties with acres of open land are wonderful — provided that land is securely fenced, which is a significant undertaking and investment when you're talking about a dog that can run at 40 mph.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="exercise-gear">
<h2>Exercise Gear</h2>

<p>The Borzoi — also known as the Russian Wolfhound — is a sighthound built for explosive speed and graceful endurance. Originally bred to chase and course wolves across the open Russian steppe, today's Borzoi carries that same athletic heritage in a lean, deep-chested frame that demands thoughtful, structured exercise. Despite their regal and sometimes aloof demeanor, Borzois are not couch dogs by nature. They require daily opportunities to run at full speed, combined with calm, moderate walks to keep their minds and joints healthy.</p>

<p>Exercising a Borzoi comes with unique challenges. Their instinct to chase moving objects is powerful and deeply hardwired — off-leash running should only happen in fully enclosed, secure areas. Their long legs, narrow skull, and sensitive skin require gear that fits their unusual proportions, and their low body fat makes them more susceptible to cold and abrasion than many other breeds. The right exercise gear isn't just a convenience for Borzoi owners — it's a safety necessity.</p>

<h3>Leash & Control Gear</h3>

<p>Because Borzois can reach speeds of 35–40 mph and will bolt after any fast-moving stimulus, leash control is critical during walks and transitions to off-leash areas. Standard flat collars are dangerous for sighthounds — the Borzoi's narrow, tapered head can easily slip out of them. You need gear designed specifically for sighthound anatomy.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Martingale Collar for Large Dogs</div>
  <p>Martingale collars are the gold standard for sighthound breeds like the Borzoi, whose narrow heads and thick necks can slide through traditional flat collars with minimal effort. The martingale's limited-slip design tightens just enough to prevent escape without choking, making it essential for leash safety during walks or when transitioning in and out of off-leash enclosures. Look for a wide-width option (1.5–2 inches) to distribute pressure evenly across the Borzoi's delicate, long neck.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Long Training Leash 30 Foot</div>
  <p>A long-line leash gives Borzois the ability to stretch their legs, sniff, and move at a more natural pace during exercise sessions when a fully enclosed field isn't available. The 30-foot length allows the Borzoi to build up a light canter — satisfying their sighthound drive to move — while keeping them safely tethered. Choose a lightweight biothane or nylon option that won't drag heavily on the ground or tangle in the Borzoi's feathered legs and long coat.</p>

</div>

<h3>Off-Leash Running & Lure Coursing</h3>

<p>The single best form of exercise for a Borzoi is unrestricted sprinting in a fully fenced area. Lure coursing — a sport that simulates prey chase using a mechanized lure on a track — is the ideal structured outlet for their predatory instinct. Even informal backyard sprinting sessions satisfy the Borzoi's deep need to run at full speed. The gear below supports safe, high-intensity free running.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Lure Coursing Set for Dogs</div>
  <p>A backyard lure coursing kit taps directly into the Borzoi's ancient prey-drive instincts, providing mentally stimulating, high-intensity exercise that flat walks simply cannot replicate. The mechanical lure mimics the erratic movement of fleeing prey, triggering the Borzoi's full athletic potential and allowing them to reach and sustain their natural sprint speeds. Regular lure coursing sessions also provide an excellent outlet that reduces restless or destructive behavior in under-exercised Borzois.</p>

</div>

<h3>Comfort & Weather Protection</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's striking silhouette — long, fine-boned legs, a deep but narrow chest, and minimal body fat — makes standard dog apparel a poor fit. Despite their thick, silky coat, Borzois get cold quickly due to their lack of insulating fat, and their prominently boned body is prone to pressure sores if they rest on hard surfaces after vigorous exercise.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Dog Coat for Large Sighthound Breeds</div>
  <p>A properly fitted sighthound coat is not a luxury item for the Borzoi — it's practical cold-weather exercise gear. Borzois have virtually no subcutaneous fat to insulate them during outdoor runs in cold climates, and their thin skin over bony prominences is vulnerable to windchill and dampness. Look for a coat specifically designed for deep-chested, narrow-waisted sighthound anatomy, which will cover the chest and belly without restricting the long, sweeping stride the breed depends on during runs.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Orthopedic Dog Cot Elevated Bed</div>
  <p>After high-speed runs, the Borzoi's angular frame — with prominent hip bones, shoulder blades, and spine — needs a supportive resting surface to prevent pressure sores and joint discomfort during recovery. An elevated cot-style bed keeps the Borzoi off cold floors while distributing body weight evenly across the mesh surface, protecting the bony prominences that standard flat beds leave exposed. This is especially important for Borzois who spend time outdoors before or after exercise sessions.</p>

</div>

<h3>Breed-Specific Exercise Tips</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Always use a securely fenced area for off-leash running.</strong> Borzois will pursue moving targets at full speed and are too fast to recall once a chase begins.</li>
  <li><strong>Avoid strenuous exercise immediately before or after meals.</strong> Like other deep-chested breeds, the Borzoi is at elevated risk for bloat (GDV), and vigorous activity around feeding time increases that risk significantly.</li>
  <li><strong>Two exercise modes are ideal:</strong> one vigorous sprint session per day paired with one or two leisurely long walks. Borzois are not built for sustained jogging on hard pavement.</li>
  <li><strong>Puppies need restricted exercise.</strong> Borzoi growth plates close slowly — avoid repetitive high-impact exercise until at least 18 months of age to protect developing joints.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental enrichment matters too.</strong> Scent work and gentle training sessions between run days prevent the boredom that leads to anxious or destructive behavior in sighthounds.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the right gear and a routine that respects their sighthound nature, the Borzoi becomes one of the most rewarding athletic companions imaginable — effortlessly elegant in motion, deeply bonded to their people, and genuinely thriving when given the space and tools to run.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="coat-care">
<h2>Coat Care & Brushing</h2>

<p>The Borzoi's coat is one of the breed's most striking features — a long, silky, slightly wavy or curly mantle that flows elegantly over a lean, athletic frame. According to the AKC standard, the coat should be silky and flat, with a wavy or curly quality (never woolly), and may feature a short, smooth coat on the head, ears, and front of legs. Despite its luxurious appearance, the Borzoi coat is surprisingly manageable compared to many other long-coated breeds — but "manageable" still requires a real commitment.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Borzoi Coat</h3>
<p>Borzois have a single or semi-double coat that lacks the dense, matting undercoat found in many other large breeds. Males typically carry heavier coats with a thick frill around the neck and chest, while females tend to have softer, flatter coats. The coat comes in virtually any color or combination, with no color preference in the breed standard. Because the hair is silky rather than cottony, mats are less aggressive than in Poodles or Collies, but they do form — particularly behind the ears, in the armpits, around the collar, and between the hindquarters.</p>

<h3>Brushing Frequency and Tools</h3>
<p>Plan to brush your Borzoi two to three times per week, increasing to daily sessions during the spring and fall shedding seasons. Despite the breed's refined appearance, they do shed — sometimes significantly — so regular brushing is as much about managing loose hair in the home as it is about coat health.</p>

<p>Recommended tools include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Pin brush:</strong> Your primary everyday tool. Use a quality bristle-and-pin combination brush or a straight pin brush to work through the silky outer coat without causing breakage.</li>
  <li><strong>Wide-tooth comb:</strong> Essential for working through the feathering on the legs, tail, and britches (the longer hair on the hindquarters). A greyhound comb — a long, metal comb with both wide and narrow teeth — is the gold standard for this breed.</li>
  <li><strong>Slicker brush:</strong> Use lightly and carefully on mat-prone areas. Too much pressure with a slicker can damage the silky texture of the coat.</li>
  <li><strong>Detangling spray:</strong> A light spritz of diluted conditioner or a commercial detangler makes brushing easier and reduces breakage, especially on the feathering.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brushing Technique</h3>
<p>Always brush in the direction of hair growth, working in sections. Start at the hindquarters and work forward, which helps you identify any forming mats before they tighten. Part the coat gently and brush from the skin outward — never drag a brush through a tangle. When you encounter a mat, hold the hair firmly at the base (close to the skin) to prevent pulling, and work the comb through from the tips inward. For persistent mats, apply detangling spray and allow it to sit for a minute before working through.</p>

<p>Pay extra attention to the neck frill, armpits, and the area behind the ears. These spots mat fastest, especially on dogs who wear collars or harnesses regularly. A Borzoi wearing a martingale collar daily may develop friction mats around the neck within days if not checked.</p>

<h3>Seasonal Shedding</h3>
<p>Borzois undergo two major coat blows per year — typically in spring and autumn. During these periods, loose undercoat and outer coat release in significant quantities. Brushing every day (or even twice daily for heavily coated dogs) during these weeks will dramatically reduce the amount of hair that ends up on furniture and clothing. A de-shedding tool or a fine-toothed undercoat rake can help pull out loose hair efficiently during the blow, but use these tools gently — the Borzoi coat is silky, not dense, and aggressive de-shedding tools can strip and damage the coat texture.</p>

<h3>Trimming and Tidying</h3>
<p>Show dogs are presented largely natural, but pet owners may choose to lightly tidy the feet (trimming hair between and around the pads for hygiene and traction), the sanitary areas, and occasionally the ear canal opening. Full trimming or clipping of the coat is generally not recommended and will alter the coat's natural texture over time. Most Borzoi owners find professional grooming appointments every eight to twelve weeks sufficient for trimming the practical areas, with home brushing sessions maintaining the coat between visits. Budget approximately $75–$150 per grooming appointment depending on your location and the dog's coat condition.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="bathing">
<h2>Bathing & Skin Care</h2>

<p>Bathing a Borzoi is an experience in contrasts — you're dealing with a dog the size of a small deer who possesses the temperament of a gentle aristocrat and the coat of a runway model. The good news is that the Borzoi's silky coat doesn't trap dirt the way a dense, double coat does, and a well-maintained Borzoi has a surprisingly clean, odor-free quality. That said, bathing done correctly makes an enormous difference in coat quality, skin health, and overall comfort for this elegant breed.</p>

<h3>How Often to Bathe a Borzoi</h3>
<p>Most Borzoi owners find that bathing every four to six weeks strikes the right balance between cleanliness and coat health. Bathing too frequently strips the natural oils from the coat, leaving it dry, brittle, and prone to breakage — a real concern for a breed whose coat is a defining characteristic. If your Borzoi rolls in something unpleasant (a Borzoi specialty), a spot-clean or a targeted rinse is usually sufficient without a full bath.</p>

<p>Between baths, a dry shampoo powder or a lightly dampened cloth can refresh the coat. Many Borzoi owners keep a spray bottle of diluted coat conditioner on hand for quick touch-ups before a show or outing.</p>

<h3>Bathing Setup</h3>
<p>Adult Borzois typically weigh 60–105 pounds and stand 26–28 inches at the shoulder — sometimes taller. That size means a standard bathtub is your most practical option at home, though a walk-in shower with a handheld sprayer works even better. A rubber non-slip mat on the tub floor is essential; a Borzoi who feels unstable on a slick surface will scramble, and their long, slender legs are not designed for that kind of stress.</p>

<p>If bathing at home feels unmanageable, self-wash stations at pet supply stores (equipped with raised tubs, restraint loops, and handheld sprayers) are an excellent alternative. Budget $15–$25 per self-wash session, versus $75–$150 for a full professional groom.</p>

<h3>Choosing the Right Products</h3>
<p>Product selection matters significantly for a Borzoi. Look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A moisturizing or whitening shampoo:</strong> For white or parti-colored Borzois, a gentle whitening shampoo helps maintain coat brightness without bleaching agents that dry the skin. For darker coats, a color-enhancing or general moisturizing formula works well.</li>
  <li><strong>A quality conditioner or conditioning rinse:</strong> This step is non-negotiable for the Borzoi. A leave-in or rinse-out conditioner protects the silky coat texture, prevents static, and makes brushing post-bath dramatically easier. Look for products containing natural oils (argan, coconut) or silk proteins.</li>
  <li><strong>A pH-balanced, dog-specific formula:</strong> Never use human shampoo. A dog's skin has a different pH than human skin (closer to neutral at 6.5–7.5), and human products — even "gentle" ones — can disrupt the skin barrier and cause dryness or irritation.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Bathing Process</h3>
<p>Thoroughly wet the coat before applying shampoo — the Borzoi's silky coat can take longer to saturate than you expect. Apply shampoo in sections, working from neck to tail and then into the legs and tail feathering. Massage gently to avoid tangling. Rinse extremely thoroughly; shampoo residue left in the coat causes itching and dullness. Follow with conditioner, concentrating on the feathering, britches, and neck frill, then rinse again completely.</p>

<p>Squeeze — don't wring — excess water from the coat. Wringing can cause breakage and mats. Wrap the dog in a large, absorbent towel and blot the coat before moving to drying.</p>

<h3>Drying</h3>
<p>Proper drying is critical for Borzois. Air drying alone can lead to matting as the coat dries in a compressed, tangled state. Use a high-velocity pet dryer or a quiet stand dryer set to a low-heat or no-heat setting to blow the coat dry while brushing it smooth. Work in sections with a pin brush as you dry, training the coat to lie flat and smooth. The entire drying process for a fully coated adult Borzoi can take 30–60 minutes. Avoid high heat, which damages the silky texture and can cause skin irritation.</p>

<h3>Skin Care Considerations</h3>
<p>Borzois are generally not prone to excessive skin problems, but their lean build means they have less fat insulation, making them more sensitive to environmental dryness in winter. If your Borzoi shows signs of dry, flaky skin — particularly along the back and flanks — consider adding a small amount of fish oil to their diet (approximately 1,000 mg per 20 lbs of body weight, or as directed by your veterinarian). Check skin condition during every brushing session, parting the coat to inspect for redness, hot spots, or unusual flaking. Any persistent skin irritation warrants a veterinary consultation.</p>

<h2>Nail, Ear & Dental Care</h2>

<p>Grooming a Borzoi isn't just about that magnificent coat. Nail, ear, and dental care form the unglamorous but absolutely essential foundation of this breed's overall health maintenance. Neglecting these areas can lead to pain, infection, and expensive veterinary bills — none of which suit a breed whose dignified bearing suggests it was born for a more elegant existence.</p>

<h3>Nail Care</h3>
<p>Borzois have long, lean feet with well-arched toes — a foot built for speed and traction on varied terrain. Long nails compromise that structure significantly. When nails are allowed to grow too long, they push the toes upward, altering the dog's gait and putting strain on the joints — a concern in any large breed, but particularly in a sighthound built for explosive speed. As a rule of thumb, if you can hear the nails clicking on a hard floor, they're already too long.</p>

<p>Trim nails every three to four weeks. Borzois who exercise regularly on pavement will wear their nails somewhat naturally, but most still need routine trimming. Use a quality guillotine-style clipper or a scissor-style clipper designed for large breeds, or a rotary grinding tool if your dog tolerates the sound and vibration. The quick (the blood vessel inside the nail) can be difficult to identify in dark-nailed dogs — trim small amounts at a time, looking for the chalky white cross-section to give way to a gray or pink center, which signals you're approaching the quick. Keep styptic powder on hand for accidental quick cuts.</p>

<p>Many Borzois are sensitive about their feet — introduce nail handling from puppyhood, pairing it with high-value treats and keeping sessions short and positive. A dog who accepts nail trimming calmly is a genuine quality-of-life asset for both owner and dog. Professional nail trims at a groomer or veterinary clinic typically cost $10–$20 and are well worth it if home trimming proves stressful.</p>

<h3>Ear Care</h3>
<p>The Borzoi carries its ears in a characteristic "rose ear" position — folded back along the neck when at rest, with the ear flap folded over and back to expose the inner ear. This ear carriage actually offers relatively good air circulation, making Borzois less prone to the chronic ear infections that plague drop-eared breeds like Basset Hounds or Cocker Spaniels. That said, ears still require regular attention.</p>

<p>Check the ears weekly by gently folding back the ear flap and inspecting the canal opening. Healthy ears are pale pink, odor-free, and produce minimal waxy discharge. Signs of a problem include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Dark brown or black discharge</li>
  <li>A yeasty, sweet, or foul odor</li>
  <li>Redness or swelling of the ear canal</li>
  <li>Repeated head shaking or pawing at the ears</li>
  <li>Sensitivity when the ear is touched</li>
</ul>

<p>For routine cleaning, apply a veterinarian-approved ear cleaning solution to a cotton ball or gauze pad and gently wipe the visible inner surfaces of the ear flap and the outer canal opening. Never insert cotton swabs or any instrument deep into the ear canal. Clean ears when dirty or every two to three weeks as a preventive measure — over-cleaning can irritate healthy ears. If you notice any of the warning signs listed above, consult your veterinarian rather than attempting to treat the condition at home.</p>

<h3>Dental Care</h3>
<p>Dental disease is one of the most underaddressed health issues in dogs of all breeds, and Borzois are no exception. Studies suggest that by age three, the majority of dogs show some signs of periodontal disease. Left untreated, dental disease doesn't just cause bad breath and tooth loss — the bacteria involved can enter the bloodstream and contribute to heart, kidney, and liver disease, all significant concerns in a breed that owners hope to keep healthy into its 10–12 year lifespan.</p>

<p>The gold standard is daily tooth brushing. Use a soft-bristled toothbrush (a finger brush works well for dogs) and a dog-specific enzymatic toothpaste. Human toothpaste contains fluoride and xylitol — both toxic to dogs — and should never be used. Start with short sessions, allowing the dog to lick the toothpaste off the brush before gradually introducing the brushing motion along the gum line. Most dogs tolerate this well once it becomes a routine.</p>

<p>If daily brushing isn't realistic, aim for a minimum of three times per week and supplement with:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Dental chews:</strong> Look for products carrying the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) seal, which indicates clinically proven effectiveness. Products like Greenies or Virbac C.E.T. chews are well-regarded options.</li>
  <li><strong>Water additives:</strong> Some dogs tolerate dental water additives that help reduce plaque and tartar formation passively.</li>
  <li><strong>Raw bones:</strong> Some owners use raw meaty bones under veterinary guidance as a natural dental cleaning method, though this comes with its own set of safety considerations regarding bone size and supervision.</li>
</ul>

<p>Schedule a professional dental cleaning with your veterinarian when advised — typically every one to three years depending on the individual dog's dental health. Professional cleanings require anesthesia, which can feel daunting, but veterinary anesthesia protocols are well-established and safe for healthy adult Borzois. The cost varies widely but typically ranges from $300–$800 depending on your location and the extent of cleaning needed. Regular home care dramatically reduces how often professional cleanings are required.</p>

<h2>Grooming Tools & Products</h2>

<h3>Understanding the Borzoi Coat</h3>

<p>The Borzoi is one of the most visually striking sighthounds in the world, and much of that elegance comes from its flowing, silky coat. Unlike the dense double coats of many large breeds, the Borzoi sports a long, flat or wavy outer coat that is naturally silky to the touch, with a softer undercoat that varies in thickness depending on climate and season. The coat is notably longer around the neck (forming a frill), on the tail, and on the hindquarters, while remaining shorter on the head, ears, and front of the legs.</p>

<p>Despite its dramatic appearance, the Borzoi coat is surprisingly low-maintenance compared to other long-haired breeds. It does not mat as aggressively as a Collie or Afghan Hound coat, but it does shed — particularly in spring and fall — and it will tangle without regular attention. The silky texture means you need tools designed for fine, longer hair rather than the heavy-duty, wide-tined instruments used for thick double coats. Using the wrong tools can break the coat, create frizz, or damage the natural wave pattern that gives the Borzoi its signature look.</p>

<p>A proper Borzoi grooming routine should include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Brushing 2–3 times per week (daily during shedding season)</li>
  <li>Detangling the feathering on the legs, tail, and neck frill regularly</li>
  <li>Occasional bathing with a coat-enhancing shampoo and conditioner</li>
  <li>Routine nail trimming, ear cleaning, and dental care</li>
  <li>Checking the long feathering for burrs, debris, and tangles after outdoor runs</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brushes & Detangling Tools</h3>

<p>The right brush makes the difference between a gleaming, tangle-free Borzoi coat and a broken, frizzy one. Because the Borzoi's silky hair is fine compared to heavier double-coated breeds, you want tools that glide through without unnecessary friction or static.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Chris Christensen Pin Brush for Long-Coated Dogs</div>
  <p>The Borzoi's long, silky coat requires a pin brush with smooth, rounded tips that separate strands without snagging or breaking the fine hair. Chris Christensen's professional-grade pin brushes are a favorite among sighthound owners and show handlers precisely because they work through length and feathering gently, preserving the natural wave and sheen that defines the breed. Use this brush for routine maintenance on the frill, tail plume, and hindquarter feathering.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Andis Steel Greyhound Comb (Fine/Coarse Combination)</div>
  <p>A steel comb is an essential finishing tool for Borzoi owners, particularly for working through the feathering behind the legs and ears where tangles tend to hide beneath an otherwise smooth surface. The dual-sided design — with both fine and coarse teeth — lets you switch between loosening thicker tangles and finishing with a fine pass for a polished look. Steel combs are also more hygienic and durable than plastic alternatives, which can create static that disrupts the Borzoi's silky coat.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: The Furminator Undercoat Deshedding Tool (Long Hair, Large Dog)</div>
  <p>During the Borzoi's seasonal shedding periods — especially spring — the undercoat loosens significantly and can cause the long outer coat to clump and tangle if not removed. The Furminator reaches through the silky outer layer to safely pull out loose undercoat without cutting or damaging the topcoat, dramatically reducing the amount of fine hair left on furniture and clothing. Use it sparingly and gently on Borzoi compared to heavier double-coated breeds — one or two passes per session is typically sufficient.</p>

</div>

<h3>Shampoo & Conditioning Products</h3>

<p>Because the Borzoi coat is naturally silky rather than coarse or wiry, harsh shampoos can strip the oils that give it its characteristic luster. The ideal bathing routine prioritizes moisture retention, coat enhancement, and gentle cleansing. Borzoi don't need frequent baths — every four to six weeks is usually sufficient — but when you do bathe, product selection matters.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Bio-Groom Super Cream Dog Conditioner</div>
  <p>The Borzoi's long coat benefits enormously from a leave-in or rinse-out conditioner that smooths the hair cuticle and prevents the static tangles that can follow bathing. Bio-Groom Super Cream is a professional-grade conditioning cream widely used by sighthound breeders and show exhibitors to maintain coat softness and reduce post-bath frizz. Applied after shampooing, it restores the silky drape and natural movement that makes the Borzoi coat so visually distinctive.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Veterinary Formula Clinical Care Antiseptic & Antifungal Shampoo</div>
  <p>While a gentle, moisturizing shampoo works for routine baths, Borzoi owners should keep a medicated option on hand — particularly because the breed's skin, though not especially prone to chronic conditions, can react to environmental allergens picked up during high-speed runs through fields, brush, and tall grass. This veterinarian-developed shampoo addresses mild skin irritation and surface bacteria without the harsh stripping effects of stronger medicated products, making it safe for occasional use on the Borzoi's fine, sensitive coat.</p>

</div>

<h3>Nail & Finishing Care</h3>

<p>As a breed built for explosive speed and agile turning, the Borzoi's nails and feet deserve particular attention. Overgrown nails alter the foot structure and can affect the breed's elegant, efficient gait. Because Borzoi tend to have deep nail beds, a sturdy, sharp nail tool is essential.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Millers Forge Professional Dog Nail Clipper (Large)</div>
  <p>The Borzoi's large, arched feet and deep nail beds require a nail clipper with a strong, sharp blade that can cut cleanly through thick nails in a single, confident pass. The Millers Forge Professional clipper is a longtime favorite among large-breed owners and professional groomers for its precision and durability — a clean cut is far less likely to cause splitting or cracking than the crushing action of dull or undersized clippers. Pair it with a styptic powder in case of accidental quicking.</p>

</div>

<h3>Final Grooming Notes for Borzoi Owners</h3>

<p>One of the most overlooked aspects of Borzoi coat care happens after every outdoor exercise session. This breed was built to sprint across open terrain, and the long feathering on the legs, tail, and ears acts like Velcro for burrs, twigs, seeds, and debris. A quick post-run inspection and comb-through before debris has a chance to work deeper into the coat will save considerable detangling effort later.</p>

<p>The Borzoi's coat may look high-maintenance, but with the right tools and a consistent routine, it remains one of the more manageable long coats in the dog world. The payoff — a gleaming, silky, effortlessly aristocratic dog — is more than worth the investment.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="home-setup">
<h2>Home Setup</h2>

<p>The Borzoi — also known as the Russian Wolfhound — is an ancient sighthound of breathtaking elegance, but living with one requires thoughtful preparation. These dogs are large (typically 60–105 lbs), built for explosive speed, and surprisingly sensitive in temperament. Despite their athletic capability, Borzois are notoriously calm and even cat-like indoors, spending much of their time lounging in regal repose. However, their sheer size, deep chest, silky long coat, and delicate digestive system all demand specific home accommodations. Setting up your home correctly from the start will keep your Borzoi comfortable, safe, and thriving.</p>

<h3>Rest and Sleep: Giving Your Borzoi the Space They Deserve</h3>

<p>Borzois are champion nappers. They are not small dogs, and their long, narrow frames and bony prominences — particularly hips, elbows, and shoulders — make them highly prone to pressure sores if forced to rest on hard or thin surfaces. An orthopedic bed is not a luxury for this breed; it is a necessity. A Borzoi will also frequently drape themselves across furniture, so providing an appropriately sized, supportive alternative is your best defense against a hijacked couch.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: FurHaven Orthopedic Giant Dog Bed</div>
  <p>Borzois need an extra-large orthopedic surface that accommodates their full stretched-out length — often 4 to 5 feet — while cushioning bony pressure points like hips and elbows. This egg-crate foam base distributes weight evenly, helping to prevent the calluses and sores that commonly develop on thin-coated, lean-bodied sighthounds. The low-entry bolster design is also easier on the Borzoi's long, flexible spine when getting up and lying down.</p>

</div>

<h3>Feeding Setup: Protecting the Deep-Chested Borzoi from Bloat</h3>

<p>Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus, or GDV) is one of the most serious health risks for deep-chested breeds like the Borzoi. The condition can be rapidly fatal. An elevated feeding station is a widely recommended precaution for this body type, and it pairs naturally with the Borzoi's tall, arched neck — bending all the way to the floor to eat puts unnecessary strain on their structure and may increase air intake. Slow-feed bowls are equally important, as Borzois can be enthusiastic eaters despite their aristocratic appearance.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Neater Feeder Elevated Dog Bowl Stand (Large)</div>
  <p>This elevated feeding station raises food and water to a comfortable height for a tall sighthound, reducing the neck strain and aerophagia (air swallowing) associated with floor-level feeding — both of which are risk factors for bloat in deep-chested breeds like the Borzoi. The contained design also catches spills, which is particularly helpful given the Borzoi's long, silky ear fringe that often dips into water bowls. It fits standard large bowls and is sturdy enough not to tip under an enthusiastic eater.</p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Neater+Feeder+Elevated+Dog+Bowl+Stand+Large&tag=onamzalikamci-20" class="product-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">View on Amazon</a>
</div>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Outward Hound Fun Feeder Slow Bowl (Large)</div>
  <p>Borzois should never be allowed to eat rapidly, especially around exercise, as speed-eating significantly elevates bloat risk in barrel-chested sighthounds. This slow-feed bowl uses raised ridges to extend mealtime and naturally pace your Borzoi's intake. The large size accommodates the volume a full-grown Borzoi needs without requiring multiple refills that might tempt rushed eating behavior.</p>

</div>

<h3>Coat Care Station: Managing the Borzoi's Silky, Long Fur</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's famously silky, wavy coat is one of the breed's most defining features — and one of its highest-maintenance characteristics. While it does not mat as readily as a Poodle or Doodle coat, it does tangle around the ears, chest, and hindquarters, and it sheds seasonally in significant amounts. A proper grooming setup at home will save you considerable expense at professional groomers and keep your Borzoi's coat in show-worthy condition.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Chris Christensen Long Pin Slicker Brush</div>
  <p>The Borzoi's silky, flowing coat requires a long-pin slicker brush that can penetrate deep into the feathering on the legs, chest, and tail without causing static or coat breakage — a common problem with cheaper wire brushes. Chris Christensen's professional-grade tools are widely trusted in the sighthound show community specifically for their ability to glide through fine, silky textures without ripping. Regular brushing two to three times per week keeps the Borzoi's coat free of debris picked up during outdoor runs and prevents the ear-fringe tangles that develop quickly on this breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>Safety and Containment: Sighthound-Proofing Your Space</h3>

<p>The Borzoi's instinct to chase is hard-wired and operates independently of obedience training. A Borzoi that spots a squirrel, rabbit, or even a blowing plastic bag can accelerate to 35–40 mph in seconds, making outdoor containment absolutely critical. Indoors, tall baby gates are also useful for managing a large dog through a multi-room home, particularly during the puppy and adolescent stages when they are more prone to destructive exploration.</p>

<div class="product-box">
    <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Carlson Extra-Tall Walk-Through Pet Gate</div>
  <p>Standard pet gates are easily cleared by an athletic Borzoi, who can stand over 28 inches at the shoulder and jump with almost no effort. This extra-tall gate (at least 36–41 inches) provides a practical indoor barrier for managing a large sighthound through your home without resorting to closed doors that can isolate a breed prone to separation anxiety. The walk-through door design also means you won't be climbing over barriers yourself — a real advantage when sharing your home with a dog the size of a Borzoi.</p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Carlson+Extra+Tall+Walk+Through+Pet+Gate&tag=onamzalikamci-20" class="product-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">View on Amazon</a>
</div>

<h3>Final Thoughts on Borzoi Home Setup</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Prioritize a large orthopedic sleeping surface — pressure sores are a genuine risk on this lean-bodied breed</li>
  <li>Elevated feeding and slow-feed bowls are strongly advisable given the Borzoi's deep chest and bloat susceptibility</li>
  <li>Invest in quality grooming tools designed for fine, silky coats — budget tools will damage the Borzoi's signature coat over time</li>
  <li>Never rely on indoor spaces alone to contain a Borzoi with outdoor access — sighthound prey drive is not overridden by recall commands once triggered</li>
  <li>Soft, quiet environments suit this sensitive breed — Borzois do not thrive in chaotic or high-traffic homes without a calm retreat of their own</li>
</ul>

<p>With the right setup, your home will be as well-suited to a Borzoi as the grand Russian estates these dogs were bred to roam. Their needs are specific but not complicated — space, softness, safety, and a thoughtful owner who respects the sighthound's unique physical and temperamental design.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="traveling">
<h2>Traveling With Your Dog</h2>

<p>Traveling with a Borzoi is a genuinely rewarding experience — these dogs are calm, clean, and often draw admiring looks wherever they go. They are also, by any measure, a large, sight-sensitive, prey-driven sighthound, and those qualities shape every aspect of travel planning. A Borzoi who escapes in an unfamiliar location has a very slim chance of being caught — their speed (up to 35–40 mph) and their instinct to chase moving objects can make a loose dog in an unfamiliar area a genuine emergency. With the right preparation, however, the Borzoi can be an excellent travel companion.</p>

<h3>Car Travel</h3>
<p>Most Borzois travel well by car once acclimated, often being perfectly content to drape themselves across a back seat or cargo area and sleep for hours. Given their size — up to 28 inches at the shoulder and 105 pounds — a mid-size SUV, a full-size SUV, or a station wagon/crossover is the practical minimum for comfortable car travel. Compact sedans are simply not appropriate for an adult Borzoi on anything beyond a very short trip.</p>

<p>Safety restraint is important and often legally required depending on your state or country. Options include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Crash-tested harness:</strong> Look for harnesses tested by the Center for Pet Safety (CPS). The harness attaches to the seat belt for restraint in an accident. Ensure any harness fits the Borzoi's deep chest and narrow waist — sizing can be tricky, and many standard harnesses don't fit sighthound proportions well.</li>
  <li><strong>Travel crate:</strong> A properly sized, secured crate in the cargo area of an SUV or wagon is an excellent option. The crate should be large enough for the dog to stand, turn, and lie down comfortably — for an adult Borzoi, this typically means an XXL crate (48 inches or larger). Secure the crate with cargo straps so it cannot become a projectile in a crash.</li>
  <li><strong>Vehicle barrier/divider:</strong> A cargo barrier keeps the dog in the rear of the vehicle, preventing distraction but offering no crash protection. This is a minimum-safety option, best combined with a crate.</li>
</ul>

<p>Never allow a Borzoi to ride with their head out a window. At highway speeds, debris can cause serious eye injury, and the risk of the dog jumping or falling is real.</p>

<h3>Leash and Containment on the Road</h3>
<p>This cannot be overstated: a Borzoi must be on a secure leash or in a safely enclosed area at all times when outside the vehicle in an unfamiliar location. Use a martingale collar or a properly fitted sighthound-specific harness with a double-clip leash (attaching to both collar and harness) for maximum security. Standard flat collars are not safe for Borzois — their narrow heads and deep chests mean they can easily back out of a standard collar if startled. Never use a retractable leash near traffic or in areas where sudden prey-drive responses are possible.</p>

<h3>Air Travel</h3>
<p>Due to their size, adult Borzois cannot travel in the cabin of commercial aircraft — they must fly as checked baggage or cargo. This is a significant decision that many Borzoi owners and breeders advise against except when absolutely necessary. Stress, temperature extremes, and handling practices in cargo can all present risks. If air travel is unavoidable, work with an airline experienced in pet transport, book direct flights to minimize handling time, and travel during mild weather seasons to avoid temperature restrictions. Puppies being transported to new homes by breeders sometimes fly as checked baggage — consult your breeder and the airline's specific policies thoroughly.</p>

<h3>Accommodations</h3>
<p>Finding pet-friendly lodging for a large dog requires advance research. Many hotels have weight limits of 25–50 pounds, which immediately excludes most adult Borzois. Look for:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Extended-stay hotels and apartment-style accommodations, which tend to have more lenient pet policies</li>
  <li>Pet-friendly vacation rental platforms (VRBO, Airbnb) with hosts who explicitly welcome large dogs</li>
  <li>Dog-friendly motel chains with weight-limit exceptions or no weight limits at all</li>
</ul>

<p>Always call ahead and confirm the specific property's policy — website information is not always up to date. Budget an additional $25–$100 per night in pet fees, which have become standard in the industry.</p>

<h3>Packing for Your Borzoi</h3>
<p>A travel kit for a Borzoi should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Food and water in pre-measured portions (avoid switching foods during travel, which can cause digestive upset)</li>
  <li>A collapsible water bowl and a supply of bottled or filtered water for the first day in a new location</li>
  <li>Their regular collar, a backup martingale collar, and an extra leash</li>
  <li>A copy of vaccination records and veterinary contact information</li>
  <li>A photo of the dog on your phone in case of separation</li>
  <li>Their regular bed or blanket — familiar scents reduce travel anxiety significantly</li>
  <li>Pin brush, greyhound comb, and a small detangling spray for coat maintenance</li>
  <li>Any medications and a basic first aid kit</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise and Mental Health While Traveling</h3>
<p>Borzois need 30–60 minutes of vigorous exercise daily, but their sighthound instincts make off-leash exercise in unfamiliar areas genuinely dangerous. Research fenced dog parks and enclosed spaces along your route in advance. A long, brisk on-leash walk in a quiet area is safer than risking an off-leash sprint in an unknown environment. Borzois also travel mentally well — they're not a breed that tends to vocalize or become destructive with stress, but they do appreciate predictability in routine, so maintaining familiar feeding and sleep schedules as much as possible will help your dog settle quickly in each new location.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="cost">
<h2>Cost of Ownership</h2>

<p>Owning a Borzoi is a long-term financial commitment that goes well beyond the initial purchase price. These elegant Russian sighthounds are relatively rare, require specific care, and come with ongoing costs that prospective owners should carefully consider before bringing one home.</p>

<h3>Initial Purchase Price</h3>
<p>A Borzoi puppy from a reputable, health-tested breeder typically costs between <strong>$1,500 and $3,500</strong>. Show-quality dogs from champion bloodlines can exceed <strong>$4,000 to $5,000</strong>. Breeders who invest in health screenings, proper socialization, and quality nutrition for their litters will naturally charge more — and that investment is worth it. Be wary of prices significantly below this range, as they may indicate a backyard breeder or puppy mill with little regard for the breed's health or temperament.</p>

<p>Adoption is another option. Breed-specific rescues such as the Borzoi Club of America Rescue occasionally have adults available, typically for adoption fees ranging from <strong>$200 to $500</strong>. Adult Borzoi can make wonderful pets, and rescue dogs often come with some training and a clearer picture of their personality.</p>

<h3>Setup and First-Year Costs</h3>
<p>The first year is always the most expensive. Beyond the purchase price, budget for:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spay/neuter surgery:</strong> $200–$600 (often recommended after full skeletal maturity, around 18–24 months, due to the breed's size)</li>
  <li><strong>Initial vet visits and vaccines:</strong> $200–$400</li>
  <li><strong>Crate:</strong> $80–$150 (an XXL crate is necessary for this large breed)</li>
  <li><strong>Bedding and dog beds:</strong> $100–$300 (Borzoi love plush, orthopedic surfaces)</li>
  <li><strong>Collar, leash, and martingale collar:</strong> $40–$80 (a martingale collar is essential for sighthounds to prevent slipping free)</li>
  <li><strong>Food and water bowls:</strong> $20–$60 (raised feeders are commonly used)</li>
  <li><strong>Microchipping:</strong> $25–$60</li>
  <li><strong>Initial grooming tools:</strong> $50–$100</li>
</ul>
<p>Total first-year costs (excluding purchase price) can easily reach <strong>$2,000–$4,000</strong>.</p>

<h3>Annual Ongoing Costs</h3>
<p>After the first year, annual expenses generally settle into a more predictable range:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Food:</strong> $600–$1,200/year. Borzoi are large dogs (60–105 lbs) with a deep chest and sensitive digestive system, so a high-quality diet matters. Many owners feed premium kibble, raw, or a combination.</li>
  <li><strong>Routine veterinary care:</strong> $300–$600/year for wellness exams, vaccines, heartworm testing, and parasite prevention</li>
  <li><strong>Heartworm and flea/tick prevention:</strong> $150–$300/year</li>
  <li><strong>Grooming:</strong> $0–$600/year. Borzoi have a silky, flowing coat that requires regular brushing, but many owners manage grooming at home. Professional grooming, if used, runs $75–$150 per session.</li>
  <li><strong>Toys and enrichment:</strong> $100–$200/year</li>
  <li><strong>Licensing:</strong> $10–$30/year depending on location</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect to spend roughly <strong>$1,500–$3,000 per year</strong> in routine ongoing costs.</p>

<h3>Health-Related Costs</h3>
<p>Like all large, deep-chested breeds, Borzoi are susceptible to <strong>bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus)</strong>, which is a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate surgery that can cost <strong>$3,000–$7,000</strong>. Many Borzoi owners opt for a prophylactic gastropexy (stomach tacking), which costs <strong>$300–$500</strong> when done at the time of spay/neuter and can be life-saving. Other health concerns include heart conditions and degenerative myelopathy. Pet insurance is strongly recommended, with premiums ranging from <strong>$50–$120/month</strong> for a large breed.</p>

<h3>Fencing and Space Costs</h3>
<p>Borzoi are escape artists with explosive speed. A securely fenced yard — ideally <strong>5–6 feet high</strong> — is a non-negotiable safety requirement. If your property isn't already fenced, budget <strong>$2,000–$8,000+</strong> depending on yard size and fencing type.</p>

<h2>Breed-Specific Tips</h2>

<p>Borzoi are unlike almost any other dog breed. Their combination of aristocratic independence, athletic speed, and sensitive temperament means that general dog ownership advice will only get you so far. If you want to truly thrive with a Borzoi, you need to understand what makes them tick.</p>

<h3>Always Use a Martingale Collar</h3>
<p>A Borzoi's neck is longer and often narrower than their skull, which means a standard flat collar can slip right over their head in an instant. A <strong>martingale collar</strong> — which tightens slightly when tension is applied — is the standard choice for sighthound owners for exactly this reason. Never walk your Borzoi on a standard buckle collar alone, and always keep the leash clipped until you're inside a securely fenced area.</p>

<h3>Recall Is Not Reliable Off-Leash</h3>
<p>This is not a training failure — it's a biological reality. Borzoi are coursing dogs hardwired to chase. The moment they lock onto a moving target (a squirrel, a rabbit, a plastic bag blowing in the wind), their recall evaporates. Even the most well-trained Borzoi should <strong>never be trusted off-leash in an unfenced area</strong>. Their top speed reaches <strong>35–40 mph</strong>, which means danger can strike before you can react. Always use a securely fenced area for off-leash exercise.</p>

<h3>Respect Their Sensitivity</h3>
<p>Borzoi are emotionally sensitive dogs who do not respond well to harsh corrections or raised voices. They often shut down under pressure, becoming fearful or avoidant. Positive reinforcement with <strong>patience and consistency</strong> is far more effective. Keep training sessions short — 5 to 10 minutes — as Borzoi bore easily and are not naturally motivated to please the way a Labrador or Golden Retriever might be. High-value treats and a calm, encouraging tone go a long way.</p>

<h3>Manage Bloat Risk Seriously</h3>
<p>As a deep-chested breed, Borzoi are at elevated risk for <strong>gastric dilatation-volvulus (bloat)</strong>. Feed two to three smaller meals per day rather than one large meal, avoid vigorous exercise for at least an hour before and after eating, and discuss prophylactic gastropexy with your veterinarian. Know the warning signs: unproductive retching, a distended abdomen, restlessness, and excessive drooling. Bloat is fatal without emergency treatment — time matters enormously.</p>

<h3>Provide a Soft Place to Rest</h3>
<p>Borzoi have very little body fat and prominent bony protrusions, which means hard floors can cause painful pressure sores called <strong>hygromas</strong>. Invest in thick, orthopedic beds and place them throughout the home. Many Borzoi owners discover their dog has strong opinions about the best couch, so setting furniture boundaries early (or embracing the inevitable) is wise.</p>

<h3>Socialization Requires Early and Ongoing Effort</h3>
<p>Borzoi can be reserved and sometimes aloof with strangers. Without early, positive socialization, this reserve can tip into anxiety or shyness. Introduce your Borzoi puppy to a wide variety of people, sounds, surfaces, and environments between <strong>8 and 16 weeks of age</strong>. Continue socialization throughout adolescence. Well-socialized Borzoi are calm and dignified in public; undersocialized ones can become reactive or difficult to manage.</p>

<h3>Exercise Needs Are Moderate but Specific</h3>
<p>Despite their athletic build, Borzoi are not high-endurance dogs — they're sprinters, not marathon runners. They need <strong>30–45 minutes of exercise daily</strong>, including at least a few opportunities per week to run at full speed in a safely enclosed space. A lure coursing field, a securely fenced dog park, or a private fenced yard are ideal. Without regular running opportunities, Borzoi can become restless or develop destructive habits indoors.</p>

<h3>Small Pets and Borzoi Don't Always Mix</h3>
<p>The Borzoi's prey drive is strong and instinctual. Cats, rabbits, small dogs, and other small animals can trigger chase behavior that the Borzoi may not be able to control. Some Borzoi can live peacefully with cats they were raised with from puppyhood, but this varies significantly by individual. Introductions to small animals should always be managed carefully and never assumed to be safe without proven history.</p>

<h3>Coat Care Is Manageable With Routine</h3>
<p>The Borzoi's long, silky coat is beautiful but surprisingly manageable compared to other long-coated breeds — it doesn't mat as readily as a Collie or Afghan Hound coat. Brush thoroughly <strong>two to three times per week</strong> with a pin brush and metal comb, paying special attention to behind the ears, the "pants" (rear leg feathering), and the chest. Shedding is seasonal and can be heavy; a deshedding brush during blow-out season makes a real difference. Borzoi are naturally clean dogs and rarely require frequent bathing.</p>
