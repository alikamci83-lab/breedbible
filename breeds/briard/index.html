<h2>Breed Overview</h2>

<p>The Briard is one of France's oldest and most celebrated herding breeds, a powerhouse of intelligence, loyalty, and shaggy elegance that has captured hearts for centuries. Known in its homeland as the <em>Chien Berger de Brie</em>, this ancient breed was already well-established in medieval France, with documented references dating back to the 14th century. Charlemagne reportedly kept Briards, and Thomas Jefferson is credited with bringing the first Briards to American soil after his time as ambassador to France.</p>

<p>At first glance, the Briard is striking — a large, athletic dog beneath a flowing, wavy coat that gives it an almost theatrical appearance. But beneath that impressive exterior lives a working dog through and through. Bred for centuries to herd sheep across the French countryside, protecting flocks from predators while keeping them in line, the Briard developed a rare combination of independence, courage, and deep devotion to its family. French Army soldiers relied on Briards during both World Wars to carry supplies, locate wounded soldiers, and serve as sentries — a testament to the breed's extraordinary versatility and resilience.</p>

<h3>A Dog of Many Talents</h3>

<p>The Briard is not a dog that settles comfortably into the background. This is a breed that wants to be involved in everything — herding, agility, obedience, search and rescue, therapy work, and competitive dog sports. The AKC officially recognized the Briard in 1928, placing it in the Herding Group, where it remains a consistent presence in the show ring and increasingly popular in working dog competitions.</p>

<p>Today, Briards rank moderately in AKC popularity — not a fashionable trend breed, but a steady favorite among those who discover them. They are bred by passionate, dedicated enthusiasts who prioritize temperament and working ability alongside beauty. Expect to pay between <strong>$1,500 and $3,000</strong> for a puppy from a reputable breeder, with some lines from top working or show stock commanding even more.</p>

</ul>

<h3>Who Is the Briard For?</h3>

<p>The Briard is emphatically not a dog for everyone. It demands an owner who is experienced, confident, and willing to invest serious time in training, socialization, and daily exercise. This is a dog that bonds with extraordinary intensity to its family, often described by owners as having "a heart of gold wrapped in a lion's mane." When properly raised and channeled, the Briard is one of the most rewarding breeds a person can own. When neglected or under-stimulated, it can become willful, protective to a fault, and difficult to manage.</p>

<p>Active families, farmers, outdoor enthusiasts, and experienced dog owners who appreciate a thinking dog with a bold personality will find the Briard an unparalleled companion. Those looking for a low-maintenance, laid-back pet would do better to look elsewhere.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="temperament">
<h2>Temperament & Personality</h2>

<p>The Briard's personality is one of the most complex and compelling in the entire herding group. Owners frequently describe them using contradictions: fiercely independent yet deeply devoted, playful yet serious, gentle with children yet boldly protective of their territory. Understanding this breed's temperament isn't just helpful — it's essential for anyone considering bringing one home.</p>

<h3>The "Heart Wrapped in Fur" Phenomenon</h3>

<p>French breachers have a saying about the Briard: <em>"A heart of gold wrapped in fur."</em> This captures something real about the breed. Briards form extraordinarily deep bonds with their families — sometimes described as almost feline in their selectiveness. They typically attach most strongly to one person while remaining affectionate and engaged with the entire household. This loyalty is not passive; a Briard will actively seek out its people, follow them from room to room, and position itself where it can keep an eye on every family member.</p>

<p>This devotion also has a protective edge. Briards are naturally watchful and can be reserved — sometimes suspicious — with strangers. This is not aggression for its own sake, but the expression of a herding and guard dog heritage that demanded the dog assess and respond to potential threats independently. Early, broad socialization is non-negotiable with this breed.</p>

<h3>Intelligence and Independence</h3>

<p>The Briard is ranked among the more intelligent herding breeds, capable of learning complex commands and tasks with impressive speed. But intelligence in the Briard comes packaged with a working dog's independence. These dogs were bred to make decisions in the field without human direction — to assess a situation and act. That means they don't simply defer to human authority the way a Golden Retriever might. They think. They problem-solve. And sometimes, they decide they know better than you.</p>

<p>This makes training a Briard a genuinely engaging intellectual exercise. Positive reinforcement methods work best; harsh corrections tend to cause the Briard to shut down or become resentful. Consistency, fairness, and a sense of humor are your best tools. Expect training to be a lifelong commitment, not a six-week puppy class.</p>

<h3>Energy and Play</h3>

<p>Briards are high-energy dogs with a playful, sometimes clownish side that surprises owners expecting a serious working dog. They retain a puppy-like exuberance well into adulthood — males especially can remain boisterous until three or four years of age. They love to play fetch, run agility courses, learn tricks, and engage in games that challenge their minds. Bored Briards are destructive Briards; this is a breed that needs a job or a serious outlet for its energy every single day.</p>

<h3>With Children and Other Animals</h3>

<p>When raised with children, the Briard is typically wonderful — patient, engaged, and gently protective. Their herding instinct may emerge in play, with some dogs attempting to "herd" small children by nudging or circling them. This behavior is manageable with training but worth being aware of. Because of the Briard's size and exuberance, supervision with very young children is always recommended.</p>

<p>With other dogs, Briards are usually sociable when properly introduced, though same-sex aggression can occasionally be an issue, particularly in intact males. Their instinct to herd and manage other animals means they generally do fine with cats and smaller pets when raised alongside them, though their enthusiasm can be overwhelming for smaller animals.</p>

<h3>Sensitivity and Emotional Depth</h3>

<p>Perhaps the most defining personality trait of the Briard is its emotional sensitivity. These dogs pick up on the moods of their household with uncanny accuracy. They do not do well with tension, harsh environments, or erratic leadership. A Briard in a calm, consistent, loving home will thrive; one in a chaotic or emotionally charged environment may develop anxiety, fearfulness, or problematic protective behaviors. Their emotional needs are real and should be taken seriously.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="physical">
<h2>Physical Characteristics</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large, powerfully built herding dog that manages to look both rustic and regal simultaneously. Beneath the celebrated flowing coat is a well-muscled, athletic body designed for endurance, agility, and the physical demands of working with livestock across challenging terrain. Understanding the Briard's physical makeup helps owners appreciate the breed's care requirements and health considerations.</p>

<h3>Size and Build</h3>

<p>According to the AKC breed standard, male Briards stand <strong>23–27 inches</strong> at the withers, while females range from <strong>22–25.5 inches</strong>. Weight ranges from approximately <strong>55 to 100 pounds</strong>, with males typically larger than females. The Briard's body is slightly longer than it is tall, giving it a rectangular silhouette. The overall impression is one of substantial power combined with agility — this dog can sprint, turn sharply, and maintain a working trot for hours.</p>

<p>The Briard moves with a distinctive ground-covering, effortless gait that breeders sometimes describe as "quicksilver" — fluid, smooth, and efficient. This movement is a defining breed characteristic and something judges look for closely in the show ring.</p>

<h3>The Coat</h3>

<p>The Briard's coat is arguably its most defining feature and certainly its most demanding maintenance requirement. The double coat consists of a fine, tight undercoat covered by a coarse, dry, slightly wavy outer coat that falls naturally in long, flowing locks. The AKC standard specifies a minimum coat length of <strong>3 inches</strong> on the body, and many dogs carry significantly more.</p>

<p>The coat parts naturally along the spine and falls to both sides. The Briard's characteristic "beard" and eyebrows — which partially obscure the eyes — give the breed its signature expression. The hair covering the eyes is a natural and deliberate feature of the breed, providing some protection from the elements during outdoor work.</p>

<p>Accepted colors per the AKC standard include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Black</li>
  <li>Gray (various shades)</li>
  <li>Tawny (fawn to mahogany)</li>
  <li>Combinations of black and gray, or black and tawny</li>
</ul>

<p>White hairs scattered throughout the coat are permissible but not preferred. White patches or spots are a disqualification in the show ring.</p>

<h3>The Double Dewclaws</h3>

<p>One of the most distinctive physical features of the Briard — and a breed-specific requirement in the AKC standard — is the presence of <strong>double dewclaws on each rear leg</strong>. This is a breed hallmark; a Briard without double rear dewclaws is disqualified from the show ring. These dewclaws are considered a functional adaptation from the breed's working heritage, providing additional grip and stability on uneven terrain. They require regular trimming as part of routine care.</p>

<h3>Head, Eyes, and Expression</h3>

<p>The Briard's head is large and long, with a well-defined stop and strong, squared-off muzzle. The eyes are large, dark, and set somewhat wide apart, conveying an expression of intelligence, calm confidence, and alertness. The ears are set high on the head; they may be cropped (though this practice is increasingly rare and prohibited in many countries) or left natural. Natural ears lie flat against the sides of the head and are covered in long hair.</p>

<h3>Grooming Requirements</h3>

<p>The Briard's coat requires significant grooming commitment. Most dedicated owners brush or comb their Briards <strong>two to three times per week minimum</strong>, with daily attention during shedding seasons. Without regular brushing, the coat will mat — and mats in a Briard coat can become severely tangled, requiring professional grooming or even shaving. Professional grooming sessions every <strong>6–8 weeks</strong> are recommended for most owners.</p>

<p>Bathing frequency varies, but most Briards benefit from a thorough bath every <strong>4–6 weeks</strong>. The coat takes considerable time to dry thoroughly — a high-velocity dryer is extremely helpful. Many pet owners choose to keep their Briards in a shorter "pet trim" to reduce maintenance while preserving the breed's characteristic silhouette.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="right-for-you">
<h2>Is This Breed Right for You?</h2>

<p>The Briard is a magnificent dog — but it is not the right dog for every home. Before falling in love with those expressive eyes and that flowing coat, take an honest look at what this breed genuinely requires. Briards thrive with the right owners and struggle significantly without them.</p>

<h3>You Might Be a Perfect Briard Owner If...</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You have dog experience.</strong> First-time dog owners can succeed with a Briard, but it's challenging. The breed's intelligence, independence, and strong personality are best managed by someone who has navigated complex dogs before.</li>
  <li><strong>You lead an active lifestyle.</strong> Briards need a minimum of <strong>60–90 minutes of vigorous exercise daily</strong>. This is not a dog that will thrive on a 20-minute leash walk. Hiking, running, agility, fetch, herding trials — the Briard wants to do it all.</li>
  <li><strong>You want a deeply bonded companion.</strong> If you're looking for a dog that will be your shadow, your adventure partner, and your devoted family guardian, the Briard delivers this in extraordinary measure.</li>
  <li><strong>You can commit to training long-term.</strong> Briards respond beautifully to positive, consistent training. If you enjoy the process of teaching and working with a smart dog, this breed will continually impress and engage you.</li>
  <li><strong>You have adequate space.</strong> While Briards can adapt to suburban living with sufficient exercise, they do best with access to a securely fenced yard. A minimum 6-foot fence is recommended, as these athletic dogs can clear shorter barriers.</li>
  <li><strong>Grooming is something you can embrace.</strong> If you find the idea of regular brushing sessions meditative rather than burdensome, and you're willing to budget <strong>$75–$150 per professional grooming visit</strong>, the Briard's coat is manageable.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Briard May Not Be Right for You If...</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>You're away from home frequently or long hours.</strong> Briards are prone to separation anxiety and do not tolerate being left alone for extended periods on a regular basis. This is a breed that needs to be with its people.</li>
  <li><strong>You want a low-maintenance dog.</strong> Between the exercise needs, grooming requirements, and mental stimulation demands, the Briard is a significant commitment of time and energy every single day.</li>
  <li><strong>You prefer a naturally easygoing, deferential dog.</strong> The Briard has opinions and will share them. It will sometimes test boundaries and challenge decisions it disagrees with. This is charming to some owners and exhausting to others.</li>
  <li><strong>You have very small children and limited supervision time.</strong> While Briards love children, their size and herding instincts require management and supervision, particularly with toddlers.</li>
  <li><strong>You're not prepared for the financial commitment.</strong> Beyond the purchase price of <strong>$1,500–$3,000+</strong>, annual costs including food, grooming, veterinary care, and training can easily reach <strong>$2,000–$4,000 per year</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Lifestyle Compatibility</h3>

<p>Briards adapt best to active households where they have a role to play and people to bond with. They are superb companions for active singles, couples, and families with older children. They excel in rural and suburban settings and can adapt to urban life only if their exercise needs are rigorously met. Apartment living is generally not recommended unless the owner is extraordinarily committed to daily outdoor activity.</p>

<h3>Finding a Reputable Breeder</h3>

<p>If you've decided the Briard is the right breed for you, the next step is finding a reputable breeder. The <strong>Briard Club of America</strong> (BCA) is the AKC parent club and an excellent starting point. Reputable breeders will perform health testing for hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and other hereditary conditions, and will welcome your questions about temperament, lineage, and how puppies are socialized.</p>

<p>Be cautious of breeders who always have puppies available, don't ask you any questions, or cannot provide health clearances. Adoption is also a beautiful option — Briard-specific rescues exist, and the Briard Club of America maintains rescue contacts for those interested in giving an adult Briard a second chance.</p>

<p>Whatever path you take, choose carefully. The Briard is a long-term commitment — and when that match is right, it's one of the most profound bonds a dog owner can experience.</p>

<h2>Common Health Issues in Briards</h2>

<p>The Briard is a fundamentally healthy and hardy breed, shaped by centuries of working life in the French countryside. However, like all purebred dogs, they carry certain genetic predispositions that every owner and prospective buyer should understand. Knowing what to watch for — and catching problems early — can make an enormous difference in your Briard's quality of life and longevity.</p>

<h3>Hip Dysplasia</h3>
<p>Hip dysplasia is the most commonly reported orthopedic concern in Briards. This hereditary condition occurs when the hip joint develops abnormally, causing varying degrees of pain, lameness, and arthritis over time. Because Briards are large, active dogs typically weighing 55–100 pounds, stress on poorly formed joints can accelerate deterioration. Responsible breeders screen breeding stock through OFA (Orthopedic Foundation for Animals) or PennHIP evaluations before pairing dogs. If you're purchasing a puppy, always ask to see the hip clearances of both parents.</p>

<h3>Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)</h3>
<p>PRA is a degenerative eye disease that gradually destroys the photoreceptors in the retina, ultimately leading to blindness. The Briard is particularly associated with a form called <strong>Congenital Stationary Night Blindness (CSNB)</strong>, also called Retinal Dystrophy. This condition is detectable through DNA testing, and carriers can be identified before symptoms appear. Affected dogs typically show difficulty seeing in low light before experiencing broader vision loss. The Briard Club of America strongly encourages genetic testing for this condition in all breeding animals.</p>

<h3>Bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus)</h3>
<p>As a deep-chested breed, Briards are at elevated risk for bloat, or GDV. This life-threatening condition occurs when the stomach fills with gas and twists on itself, cutting off blood supply. GDV can kill a dog within hours if untreated. Warning signs include a distended abdomen, unproductive retching, restlessness, and excessive drooling. Feeding your Briard two to three smaller meals per day instead of one large meal, avoiding exercise immediately after eating, and using a slow-feeder bowl are important preventive measures. Some owners opt for a prophylactic gastropexy (surgical stomach tacking) performed during spay/neuter surgery — a conversation worth having with your veterinarian.</p>

<h3>Hypothyroidism</h3>
<p>Briards can develop hypothyroidism, a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce sufficient hormones. Symptoms include unexplained weight gain, lethargy, coat changes (thinning, dullness, or hair loss), and behavioral changes. Diagnosis is confirmed through a blood panel, and management typically involves daily oral medication (levothyroxine) that is both effective and affordable. Dogs on thyroid medication generally return to excellent health and live normal lifespans.</p>

<h3>Lymphoma</h3>
<p>Cancer, particularly lymphoma, has been noted with some frequency in the breed. While no breed is immune to cancer, Briard owners should be vigilant about lumps, bumps, swollen lymph nodes, unexplained weight loss, or changes in energy levels. Annual wellness exams with full physical assessments are critical for early detection.</p>

<h3>Elbow Dysplasia</h3>
<p>Like hip dysplasia, elbow dysplasia involves abnormal development of the elbow joint and can cause front-limb lameness, especially in growing puppies. Reputable breeders screen for this condition as well, and OFA elbow clearances should be part of any health-tested litter's documentation.</p>

<h3>Von Willebrand's Disease</h3>
<p>This inherited bleeding disorder, caused by a deficiency in Von Willebrand factor, has been identified in some Briard lines. Affected dogs may experience prolonged bleeding after injury or surgery. DNA testing can identify carriers and affected dogs, and responsible breeders screen for this condition.</p>

<h3>Finding a Health-Tested Briard</h3>
<p>The Briard Club of America recommends that breeders conduct the following health evaluations before breeding: OFA hip and elbow certification, CAER eye exam performed by a board-certified ophthalmologist, DNA test for Congenital Stationary Night Blindness, thyroid evaluation, and cardiac exam. When evaluating a breeder, ask to see documentation for all of these. Puppies from health-tested parents still carry some risk, but the odds of major inherited disease are significantly reduced.</p>

<h2>Veterinary Care Schedule for Briards</h2>

<p>Keeping your Briard on a consistent veterinary care schedule is one of the most impactful investments you can make in their long-term health. Briards are working dogs built for endurance, but they benefit enormously from proactive preventive care rather than reactive treatment. Here's a practical, breed-specific guide to what your Briard needs and when.</p>

<h3>Puppy Wellness Visits (8 Weeks to 1 Year)</h3>
<p>Briard puppies need a series of veterinary appointments during their first year to establish baseline health, complete vaccination protocols, and screen for early developmental concerns. Plan on visits roughly every 3–4 weeks during the puppy phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>8–10 weeks:</strong> First distemper-parvo combination vaccine (DA2PP), fecal exam for intestinal parasites, physical exam, and microchipping if not already done by the breeder.</li>
  <li><strong>12–14 weeks:</strong> Second DA2PP booster, leptospirosis vaccine (first dose), and Bordetella if the puppy will be in contact with other dogs.</li>
  <li><strong>16–18 weeks:</strong> Third DA2PP booster, leptospirosis booster, and rabies vaccine (required by law in most jurisdictions).</li>
  <li><strong>6 months:</strong> Pre-spay or neuter exam, discussion of timing for the procedure, and a check for any growth abnormalities. Many veterinarians recommend waiting until 18–24 months to spay or neuter large breeds like Briards to allow full musculoskeletal maturation.</li>
  <li><strong>12 months:</strong> One-year wellness exam, first adult booster vaccines, heartworm test, and baseline blood panel.</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect to spend approximately <strong>$300–$700</strong> on puppy wellness care during the first year, depending on your region and whether spay/neuter is included.</p>

<h3>Adult Annual Wellness Exams (1–7 Years)</h3>
<p>Once your Briard reaches adulthood, annual exams are the cornerstone of preventive care. A thorough annual visit should include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Full nose-to-tail physical examination, including lymph node palpation (important given Briards' lymphoma risk)</li>
  <li>Heartworm test</li>
  <li>Fecal exam for intestinal parasites</li>
  <li>Core vaccine boosters on appropriate schedules (DA2PP typically every 3 years after initial adult series; rabies per local law)</li>
  <li>Dental health assessment</li>
  <li>Weight and body condition scoring — Briards should maintain a lean, athletic build</li>
</ul>
<p>Annual wellness visits typically run <strong>$200–$400</strong> excluding any additional diagnostics.</p>

<h3>Eye Examinations</h3>
<p>Given the Briard's elevated risk for Congenital Stationary Night Blindness and other inherited eye conditions, annual CAER (Companion Animal Eye Registry) exams performed by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist are strongly encouraged. These exams cost approximately <strong>$50–$100</strong> and can detect retinal changes, cataracts, and other conditions early. If your Briard carries the CSNB gene variant, more frequent monitoring may be advised.</p>

<h3>Dental Care</h3>
<p>Briards are not especially predisposed to dental disease compared to smaller breeds, but dental health still matters. Daily tooth brushing at home is ideal, with professional dental cleanings performed under anesthesia as recommended by your veterinarian — typically every 1–3 years depending on the individual dog. Professional cleanings average <strong>$400–$800</strong> depending on location and whether extractions are needed.</p>

<h3>Parasite Prevention</h3>
<p>Monthly heartworm prevention is essential year-round in most of the United States. Combined heartworm/flea/tick preventives (such as NexGard Plus or Simparica Trio) are convenient for active dogs like Briards who spend significant time outdoors. Budget approximately <strong>$150–$300 per year</strong> for parasite prevention products.</p>

<h3>Senior Wellness Protocol (7+ Years)</h3>
<p>Briards are considered senior at around 7–8 years of age. At this stage, twice-yearly veterinary visits are recommended, with comprehensive bloodwork (complete blood count, chemistry panel, urinalysis, and thyroid levels) at least once annually. Early detection of kidney disease, hypothyroidism, and cancer becomes increasingly important. X-rays to assess hip and elbow joints may also be recommended if your dog shows any signs of stiffness or discomfort.</p>

<h3>Grooming-Related Veterinary Considerations</h3>
<p>Briards' long, dense coats can trap moisture and debris, making them prone to skin infections and hot spots if not properly maintained. If you notice redness, odor, excessive scratching, or matting near the skin, schedule a veterinary visit promptly. Ear infections are also possible in dogs with hair-covered ear canals, so regular ear checks — both at home and at the vet — are important.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="lifespan">
<h2>Lifespan & Aging in Briards</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large herding breed with a typical lifespan of <strong>10–12 years</strong>, though well-cared-for individuals occasionally reach 13–14 years. Understanding how your Briard will age — both physically and mentally — helps you anticipate their needs and make the most of every stage of life together.</p>

<h3>Puppyhood (0–18 Months)</h3>
<p>Briard puppies are energetic, curious, and mentally engaged from the very start. This breed matures more slowly than many, and the first year and a half is a period of rapid physical growth combined with significant intellectual development. Briard puppies should not be pushed into excessive exercise during this phase — long runs, repetitive jumping, or hard surfaces can stress developing joints and growth plates. Stick to free play and short structured walks until your veterinarian confirms skeletal maturity, which in large breeds typically occurs between 18 and 24 months.</p>

<h3>Adolescence (18 Months – 3 Years)</h3>
<p>Briards go through a notable adolescent phase where their bold, independent nature really asserts itself. This is the age at which many inexperienced owners find the breed challenging — the Briard is testing boundaries and figuring out their role in the family. Consistent, positive training and continued socialization are essential. Physically, dogs in this phase are approaching full adult size. Males typically reach 70–100 pounds; females usually fall between 55–75 pounds.</p>

<h3>Prime Adulthood (3–7 Years)</h3>
<p>This is the golden era of Briard ownership. A well-trained, well-socialized adult Briard is a remarkably capable companion — athletic, loyal, and deeply bonded to their family. These dogs thrive on activity and purpose, whether that's herding trials, French Ring Sport, obedience, agility, search and rescue work, or simply being a devoted family dog with a job to do. Adult Briards typically need <strong>60–90 minutes of vigorous exercise daily</strong> to remain physically and mentally satisfied.</p>

<h3>Middle Age (7–9 Years)</h3>
<p>Around age 7, many Briards begin to show subtle signs of slowing down. They may take longer to warm up before exercise, sleep more deeply, or show slightly less enthusiasm for intense activity. This is a natural transition, not a cause for alarm. Joint health becomes more important to monitor during this phase, and switching to a senior diet may be appropriate depending on body condition. Keeping your Briard at a healthy weight — not just in terms of scale weight, but in terms of body condition score — is one of the single most important things you can do to extend their comfort and lifespan during this period.</p>

<h3>Senior Years (9–12+ Years)</h3>
<p>Senior Briards are typically more mellow and affectionate than their younger counterparts, but they still benefit from daily movement and mental engagement. Gentle walks, puzzle toys, and continued social interaction help preserve cognitive function and emotional wellbeing. Conditions to monitor closely in senior Briards include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Arthritis and joint stiffness, particularly in the hips and elbows</li>
  <li>Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome (dog dementia), which can cause disorientation, changes in sleep patterns, and altered behavior</li>
  <li>Hypothyroidism, which becomes more prevalent with age</li>
  <li>Cancer, including lymphoma</li>
  <li>Dental disease</li>
  <li>Vision and hearing decline</li>
</ul>
<p>Orthopedic dog beds, ramps or steps to help with furniture access, and non-slip surfaces on hardwood floors can significantly improve a senior Briard's daily comfort and safety.</p>

<h3>Factors That Influence Lifespan</h3>
<p>Several controllable factors have a meaningful impact on how long — and how well — your Briard lives:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Healthy weight maintenance:</strong> Obesity is associated with reduced lifespan and increased joint, cardiac, and metabolic disease risk. Briards should always maintain a lean, athletic build.</li>
  <li><strong>Regular veterinary care:</strong> Biannual senior visits allow for earlier detection of developing conditions.</li>
  <li><strong>Appropriate exercise:</strong> Lifelong moderate exercise supports cardiovascular, joint, and cognitive health.</li>
  <li><strong>Quality nutrition:</strong> A high-quality diet formulated for large breeds supports musculoskeletal health throughout life.</li>
  <li><strong>Genetic background:</strong> Purchasing from health-tested parents reduces but does not eliminate the risk of inherited disease.</li>
  <li><strong>Mental stimulation:</strong> Briards are working dogs with busy minds. Boredom and inactivity contribute to stress and behavioral problems that can indirectly affect physical health.</li>
</ul>

<h3>End-of-Life Considerations</h3>
<p>When a Briard's quality of life begins to decline significantly — due to pain, loss of mobility, inability to eat or drink, or severe cognitive decline — quality of life assessments can help families make compassionate, informed decisions. Tools like the HHHHHMM Quality of Life Scale can provide a structured framework during this emotionally difficult time. Your veterinarian and veterinary team are your most important partners in navigating this chapter with your dog.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="illness-signs">
<h2>Signs of Illness in Briards</h2>

<p>Briards are stoic, resilient dogs — a trait that served them well as independent working dogs in the French countryside, but one that can make detecting illness more challenging for their owners. Because Briards often don't show obvious signs of pain or discomfort until a problem is well advanced, knowing what subtle changes to look for is critically important. When in doubt, contact your veterinarian. Early intervention almost always leads to better outcomes.</p>

<h3>General Warning Signs to Watch For</h3>
<p>Regardless of the specific condition, the following signs should prompt a veterinary call or visit:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unexplained lethargy or decreased interest in activities they normally enjoy</li>
  <li>Loss of appetite lasting more than 24 hours</li>
  <li>Significant weight loss or gain without a change in diet</li>
  <li>Vomiting or diarrhea lasting more than 24 hours, or any blood in either</li>
  <li>Excessive thirst or urination</li>
  <li>Coughing, labored breathing, or exercise intolerance</li>
  <li>Swollen or painful abdomen</li>
  <li>Limping or reluctance to bear weight on a limb</li>
  <li>Visible lumps, bumps, or swollen lymph nodes</li>
  <li>Changes in coat quality — sudden thinning, excessive shedding, or dullness</li>
  <li>Confusion, disorientation, or personality changes</li>
</ul>

<h3>Emergency Symptoms: Act Immediately</h3>
<p>The following signs represent potential emergencies. Do not wait for a regular appointment — contact an emergency veterinary clinic right away:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Bloat (GDV):</strong> Distended, hard abdomen; unproductive retching or gagging; drooling; pacing; inability to get comfortable. This is a life-threatening emergency in Briards.</li>
  <li><strong>Collapse or sudden inability to stand</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Seizures</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Pale or white gums</strong> (normal gums should be pink and moist)</li>
  <li><strong>Difficulty breathing</strong> or open-mouth breathing at rest</li>
  <li><strong>Uncontrolled bleeding</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Suspected toxin ingestion</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3>Eye-Related Warning Signs</h3>
<p>Given the Briard's hereditary risk for Congenital Stationary Night Blindness and other ocular conditions, pay particular attention to eye health:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Difficulty navigating in low light or darkness — bumping into objects, hesitating at thresholds</li>
  <li>Cloudy, hazy, or bluish appearance to the eyes</li>
  <li>Increased tearing, discharge, or squinting</li>
  <li>Redness or visible irritation around the eye</li>
  <li>Apparent loss of vision in one or both eyes</li>
</ul>
<p>If your Briard seems hesitant or anxious in dim lighting, this is one of the earliest signs of CSNB and warrants prompt evaluation by a veterinary ophthalmologist.</p>

<h3>Joint and Mobility Changes</h3>
<p>Hip and elbow dysplasia don't always present dramatically. Watch for these subtler signs, especially in puppies and young adults:</p>
<ul>
  <li>"Bunny hopping" gait — using both rear legs together rather than alternately when running</li>
  <li>Difficulty rising from a resting position, especially first thing in the morning</li>
  <li>Reluctance to climb stairs, jump into a car, or use furniture they previously accessed easily</li>
  <li>Muscle loss over the hindquarters or shoulders</li>
  <li>Audible clicking, popping, or grinding sounds from joints</li>
  <li>Licking or chewing at a specific joint</li>
</ul>

<h3>Skin and Coat Warning Signs</h3>
<p>The Briard's magnificent double coat can both hide and trap problems. Regularly parting the coat to examine the skin beneath is essential:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Redness, flaking, or raw skin hidden beneath the coat</li>
  <li>Hot spots — moist, weeping areas of skin irritation</li>
  <li>Persistent scratching, biting, or rubbing against surfaces</li>
  <li>Unusual odor coming from the coat or skin</li>
  <li>Matting close to the skin, which can harbor moisture and lead to infection</li>
</ul>

<h3>Behavioral Changes as Health Indicators</h3>
<p>Briards are emotionally sensitive and deeply attuned to routine. Behavioral shifts are often among the first signs that something is physically wrong:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Sudden aggression or irritability in a previously gentle dog — often pain-related</li>
  <li>Increased anxiety or clinginess</li>
  <li>House soiling in a previously reliable dog</li>
  <li>Disorientation, getting "lost" in familiar spaces, or staring at walls (signs of Cognitive Dysfunction Syndrome in older dogs)</li>
  <li>Changes in sleep patterns — sleeping far more or less than usual</li>
  <li>Loss of interest in play, training, or family interaction</li>
</ul>
<p>Trust your instincts. You know your Briard better than anyone. If something feels off — even if you can't pinpoint exactly what — it is always appropriate to contact your veterinarian. A phone call describing your observations can help determine whether a prompt visit is warranted or whether watchful monitoring is sufficient.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="dietary-needs">
<h2>Dietary Needs</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large, athletic herding breed with a muscular build and impressive energy reserves. Feeding this breed correctly is one of the most important investments you can make in their long-term health. A working-line Briard and a more sedentary pet-home Briard may have dramatically different caloric needs, so understanding the variables is essential before settling on any feeding plan.</p>

<h3>Caloric Requirements</h3>
<p>Adult Briards typically weigh between 55 and 100 pounds, with males on the higher end and females generally ranging from 55 to 75 pounds. A moderately active adult Briard generally requires between 1,600 and 2,400 calories per day. Working dogs, sport competitors, or dogs in colder climates may need up to 2,800 calories daily during peak activity periods. Puppies and adolescents (up to 18 months) require calorie-dense food to support rapid skeletal and muscular development but should not be overfed, as excess weight during growth can stress developing joints.</p>

<h3>Macronutrient Priorities</h3>
<p>As a muscular, active breed, the Briard thrives on a diet with a strong protein foundation. Look for foods where a named animal protein — chicken, beef, lamb, or fish — appears as the first ingredient. Target a minimum of 25–30% crude protein for active adults, and slightly higher (28–32%) for growing puppies or working dogs. Fat content should sit between 12–18% for most adults, providing the sustained energy this breed demands during long herding sessions or vigorous exercise. Puppies need slightly higher fat, around 15–20%, to fuel brain development and growth.</p>

<p>Carbohydrates should come from digestible, whole-food sources like sweet potatoes, brown rice, or oats rather than fillers like corn syrup or excessive grain fragments. Fiber supports digestive health, which matters particularly for Briards prone to bloat.</p>

<h3>Bloat Risk and Dietary Considerations</h3>
<p>Like many large, deep-chested breeds, Briards carry an elevated risk of gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), commonly called bloat. Diet plays a meaningful role in prevention. Avoid feeding one large meal per day — divide portions into at least two meals. Do not allow vigorous exercise within 60–90 minutes of feeding. Some evidence suggests avoiding foods with fat listed among the first four ingredients, and choosing kibble over food that includes citric acid as a preservative may help reduce risk. Always discuss bloat prevention strategies with your veterinarian.</p>

<h3>Joint and Coat Health Nutrients</h3>
<p>The Briard's signature double coat — long, coarse outer coat over a fine, tight undercoat — requires adequate omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids to maintain its luster and texture. Fish oil supplementation (EPA and DHA combined at approximately 20–55 mg per pound of body weight daily) can dramatically improve coat condition in dogs whose diet is lacking. For joint support, especially in older Briards or those doing heavy physical work, look for foods incorporating glucosamine (minimum 400 mg/kg) and chondroitin, or supplement separately.</p>

<h3>Foods to Avoid</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Xylitol (found in some peanut butters and sugar-free products)</li>
  <li>Grapes and raisins</li>
  <li>Onions and garlic in significant quantities</li>
  <li>Cooked bones, which can splinter and cause internal injury</li>
  <li>Highly processed foods with artificial preservatives like BHA and BHT</li>
  <li>Excessive table scraps, which can upset the digestive balance and contribute to obesity</li>
</ul>

<h3>Life Stage Adjustments</h3>
<p>Briard puppies should eat a large-breed puppy formula designed to support controlled growth — regular puppy foods can deliver too much calcium, promoting too-rapid bone development. Around 12–18 months, transition gradually to an adult formula over 7–10 days. Senior Briards (typically 7 years and older) benefit from lower-calorie, joint-supportive formulas with easily digestible proteins. Always reassess feeding amounts with your vet during annual wellness checks.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="food-recommendations">
<h2>Best Food Recommendations</h2>

<h3>What to Look for in a Briard's Food</h3>
<p>The Briard is a large, athletic French herding breed built for endurance work and long days on the move. Adults typically weigh between 55 and 100 pounds, and their muscular, hardworking bodies demand a diet that reflects their energy output. Whether your Briard is an active working dog, a competitive sport dog, or a well-exercised family companion, nutrition plays a central role in maintaining their performance, their famously long and dense double coat, and their long-term joint health.</p>

<p>The best food for a Briard should meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Made by a company with board-certified veterinary nutritionists (DACVN) on staff</li>
  <li>Meets AAFCO nutritional adequacy standards through feeding trials, not just formulation</li>
  <li>Lists a high-quality, named animal protein (chicken, beef, lamb, salmon) as the first ingredient</li>
  <li>Contains omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids to support the Briard's thick, double-layered coat</li>
  <li>Includes glucosamine and chondroitin to protect the joints of this large, active breed</li>
  <li>Provides appropriate caloric density for the individual dog's activity level — working Briards need significantly more calories than sedentary ones</li>
  <li>Includes quality, digestible carbohydrates to fuel endurance and herding-style activity</li>
  <li>Contains no artificial colors, flavors, or preservatives</li>
</ul>

<p>Briards are also known to have sensitive stomachs in some lines, and bloat (gastric dilatation-volvulus, or GDV) is a real concern for deep-chested large breeds. Feeding two or more smaller meals per day rather than one large meal, and avoiding vigorous exercise immediately after eating, are important management strategies regardless of which food you choose.</p>

<h3>Best Dry Food (Kibble) for Briards</h3>

<p>High-quality kibble is the most practical and nutritionally consistent option for most Briard owners. Look for large-breed formulas with real meat protein, healthy fats, and added joint support ingredients. Active and working Briards may benefit from a higher-protein, higher-fat formula, while less active dogs should stay on a moderate-calorie large-breed recipe to avoid unnecessary weight gain.</p>

<h3>Best Food for Briard Puppies</h3>

<p>Briard puppies grow rapidly and are considered a large breed, which means skeletal development must be carefully managed through diet. Large-breed puppy foods are specifically formulated with controlled calcium-to-phosphorus ratios to prevent the too-fast bone growth that can lead to developmental orthopedic disease. Never feed a Briard puppy a generic "all life stages" adult food or a high-calorie formula designed for small breeds.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Hill's Science Diet Large Breed Puppy Dry Dog Food</div>
  <p>Hill's Science Diet Large Breed Puppy formula provides precisely calibrated calcium and phosphorus levels to support steady, controlled bone and joint development in fast-growing Briard puppies. High-quality chicken is the first ingredient, delivering the protein young muscles need to develop properly, while DHA from fish oil supports healthy brain and eye development during the critical early months. This formula is backed by decades of clinical research and is routinely recommended by veterinarians for large breed puppies.</p>

</div>

<h3>Best Supplement Support for the Briard's Coat and Joints</h3>

<p>Even with a high-quality diet, many Briard owners choose to add targeted supplements to address this breed's two most demanding physical characteristics: a long, dense double coat that requires exceptional nutritional support from the inside out, and large joints that face wear over a lifetime of active work.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Zesty Paws Pure Wild Alaskan Salmon Oil for Dogs</div>
  <p>The Briard's signature coat — long, slightly wavy, and famously described as resembling a goat's — depends heavily on dietary fat quality to stay healthy, non-matted, and vibrant. Wild Alaskan salmon oil delivers a concentrated dose of EPA and DHA omega-3 fatty acids that directly nourish skin and coat health, reducing dryness and brittleness that can worsen tangling and matting in the Briard's long fur. As a bonus, these same omega-3s have anti-inflammatory properties that support joint comfort in this large, active breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Note on Feeding Briards</h3>
<p>Because Briards are a deep-chested large breed, they carry an elevated risk for bloat (GDV), a life-threatening condition in which the stomach twists on itself. To reduce this risk, always divide your Briard's daily food into at least two meals rather than feeding once a day, use a slow-feeder bowl if your dog eats too quickly, and avoid strenuous exercise for at least an hour before and after meals. If you ever notice a distended abdomen, unproductive retching, or sudden restlessness after eating, contact an emergency veterinarian immediately — bloat is a medical emergency.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="feeding-schedule">
<h2>Feeding Schedule</h2>

<p>Consistency is your best friend when it comes to feeding a Briard. This breed thrives on routine, and a structured feeding schedule supports not only digestive health but also reinforces the predictable daily rhythm that Briards — as working herding dogs — mentally appreciate. Beyond temperament, a well-planned schedule directly reduces the risk of bloat, one of the most serious health threats for this breed.</p>

<h3>Puppies (8 Weeks to 6 Months)</h3>
<p>Young Briard puppies have small stomachs and fast metabolisms. Feed three to four small meals evenly distributed throughout the day — morning, midday, late afternoon, and optionally a small evening meal. A typical daily food allowance for an 8-week-old Briard puppy weighing around 10–15 pounds is approximately 1.5–2 cups of large-breed puppy kibble, divided across those meals. By 12 weeks, puppies often weigh 20–30 pounds and may need 2.5–3.5 cups daily. Always follow the guidelines on your specific food's packaging and verify with your veterinarian, as individual puppies vary.</p>

<h3>Adolescents (6 to 18 Months)</h3>
<p>Between six months and roughly 18 months, Briards are in a high-growth, high-energy phase. Transition to two meals per day — morning and evening, ideally spaced 10–12 hours apart. Daily food quantities for a 50–70-pound adolescent typically range from 3–5 cups of quality kibble, though caloric density varies significantly between brands. Monitor body condition closely during this stage: you should be able to feel the ribs without pressing hard, but they should not be visibly prominent. Overfeeding adolescents risks skeletal problems; underfeeding compromises healthy development.</p>

<h3>Adults (18 Months to 7 Years)</h3>
<p>Healthy adult Briards should eat two measured meals per day. For a 70-pound moderately active adult, expect to feed approximately 3–4 cups of a high-quality dry kibble daily, divided equally. A more active 90-pound male working dog may require 4.5–5.5 cups. Always measure portions with a proper measuring cup — estimating by eye leads to chronic overfeeding more often than not.</p>

<p>Maintain a consistent feeding window each day. For example, 7:00 AM and 6:00 PM works well for most household schedules and gives adequate time between the evening meal and overnight. Remove the food bowl after 15–20 minutes whether the dog has finished or not. Free feeding (leaving food available all day) is strongly discouraged for Briards because it undermines portion control and increases bloat risk.</p>

<h3>Timing and Exercise: The Bloat Rule</h3>
<p>This cannot be overstated: never allow your Briard to engage in vigorous exercise within 60–90 minutes before or after eating. No fetch sessions, no agility practice, no running alongside your bike. A brief, calm leash walk is acceptable, but anything that raises the heart rate significantly should be avoided during the post-meal window. Many Briard owners schedule exercise sessions first thing in the morning before breakfast, and again in the early afternoon — well separated from the evening meal.</p>

<h3>Senior Dogs (7 Years and Older)</h3>
<p>Senior Briards often become less active and their metabolism slows, making weight management increasingly important. Continue two meals daily but reduce total calories by approximately 20–30% unless your dog remains highly active. Switching to a senior-formulated food or a lighter adult formula helps prevent creeping weight gain. Older dogs may also benefit from smaller, more frequent meals (three per day) if they show signs of digestive sensitivity.</p>

<h3>Treats and Extras</h3>
<p>Treats should account for no more than 10% of your Briard's daily caloric intake. For a 70-pound adult consuming roughly 1,800 calories, that caps treats at about 180 calories — the equivalent of a small handful of commercial training treats. Use treats strategically during training sessions and deduct the calories from the daily meal allotment. Healthy treat options include small pieces of plain cooked chicken, carrot sticks, blueberries, or low-calorie commercial treats.</p>

<h3>Water</h3>
<p>Fresh water should be available at all times, but avoid allowing your Briard to gulp enormous quantities of water immediately before or after meals. Deep-chested breeds that rapidly swallow large amounts of air or water are at heightened GDV risk. Keep water bowls filled but moderate access around mealtime.</p>

<h2>Food Bowls & Accessories</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large, athletic French herding breed with a distinctive long, flowing double coat and an impressive beard and mustache. These physical characteristics — combined with the breed's deep chest, enthusiastic eating style, and high energy demands — make thoughtful mealtime setup essential. Briards typically weigh between 55 and 100 pounds and require feeding equipment designed for large, deep-chested dogs. Their abundant facial furnishings (that glorious beard!) are beautiful but notoriously food-trapping, making bowl shape and design a real practical concern for owners. Additionally, because Briards are susceptible to bloat (Gastric Dilatation-Volvulus, or GDV) like many large, deep-chested breeds, how and where they eat matters just as much as what they eat.</p>

<h3>What to Look for in Briard Feeding Equipment</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Deep, narrow bowl designs that keep that magnificent beard out of the food</li>
  <li>Slow-feeder options to reduce the risk of bloat in this deep-chested breed</li>
  <li>Elevated or adjustable feeders to promote comfortable posture for a large dog</li>
  <li>Stainless steel or ceramic materials — easy to sanitize and free from harmful plastics</li>
  <li>Weighted or non-slip bases to prevent the Briard's enthusiastic eating from sending bowls across the floor</li>
  <li>Sufficient capacity for a large-breed meal portion (at least 6–8 cup capacity)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Bowls for Briards with Beards</h3>

<p>The Briard's signature beard is one of the breed's most endearing traits — but it becomes a liability at mealtime. Food particles, moisture, and debris collect in those long facial furnishings after every meal, leading to odor, skin irritation around the muzzle, and constant cleanup. A tall, narrow "spaniel-style" or snout-specific bowl keeps the beard elevated above the food while the dog eats, dramatically reducing mess and post-meal grooming time.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Spaniel Bowls Stainless Steel Narrow Dog Bowl</div>
  <p>Designed specifically for long-eared and long-bearded breeds, this tall, narrow stainless steel bowl allows the Briard to eat comfortably while keeping its distinctive beard and facial furnishings clear of food and water. Stainless steel resists bacterial buildup, which is especially important given how much moisture a Briard's beard can trap against the muzzle. The deep design also slows eating slightly, offering a minor but helpful benefit for a bloat-prone breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>Slow Feeders & Bloat Prevention</h3>

<p>Bloat (GDV) is one of the most serious health risks facing the Briard. Deep-chested, large breeds that eat quickly and exercise around mealtimes are at elevated risk. Slowing your Briard's eating pace is one of the most effective preventive measures owners can take. Slow-feeder bowls with internal ridges or maze patterns force the dog to eat around obstacles, significantly extending mealtime and reducing the amount of air swallowed.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Outward Hound Fun Feeder Slow Bowl Large</div>
  <p>The Outward Hound Fun Feeder features a maze-style interior that forces large dogs like the Briard to eat around ridges and channels, slowing consumption by up to 10 times compared to a standard bowl. This is critically important for the Briard's deep-chested build, which makes the breed prone to GDV when large amounts of food are consumed rapidly. The bowl's non-slip base also prevents the enthusiastic Briard from pushing it across the floor during mealtimes.</p>

</div>

<h3>Elevated Feeders</h3>

<p>For a large breed like the Briard, elevated feeders reduce the strain on the neck and joints during meals — a genuine comfort consideration for a dog that may stand 22–27 inches at the shoulder. An adjustable elevated feeder also grows with the dog from puppyhood through adulthood. Note: While elevated feeders offer ergonomic comfort, consult your veterinarian about their use in bloat-prone breeds, as research on their role in GDV risk continues to evolve.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: PAWFECT PETS Elevated Dog Bowl Stand Adjustable Large</div>
  <p>This adjustable elevated feeder accommodates the Briard's large frame with multiple height settings, allowing owners to find the most ergonomically comfortable feeding position as the dog matures. The raised position reduces neck and shoulder strain during meals, which is particularly valuable for senior Briards or dogs with joint concerns common in large herding breeds. The stainless steel bowls included are easy to remove for thorough washing — essential for keeping a Briard's beard-adjacent feeding area hygienic.</p>

</div>

<h3>Water Stations</h3>

<p>Briards are enthusiastic drinkers, and that magnificent beard acts like a sponge — soaking up water and then dripping it across your floors for several minutes after every drink. A no-spill or drip-reducing water bowl is a quality-of-life upgrade that most Briard owners consider non-negotiable.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: MalsiPree Large Dog Water Bowl No-Spill</div>
  <p>This floating disk water bowl is specifically engineered to minimize the amount of water a dog can scoop up with each drink, dramatically reducing the post-drinking drip trail that Briard owners know all too well. The large capacity suits the Briard's size and hydration needs, while the non-spill design helps keep that impressive beard from becoming completely saturated during every water break. The wide, stable base prevents tipping — important for an active, large herding breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>Food Storage & Portion Management</h3>

<p>Briards are large, active dogs whose caloric needs fluctuate significantly with exercise level and life stage. Keeping food fresh and portions accurate is essential to maintaining a healthy weight and preventing the obesity that can stress joints in a large herding breed.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Gamma2 Vittles Vault Airtight Large Dog Food Storage Container</div>
  <p>The Vittles Vault uses an airtight gamma seal to keep large-breed kibble fresh, preserving the fats and vitamins that are critical to supporting the Briard's high-energy lifestyle and luxurious double coat. Its large capacity handles the big bags of food that Briard owners typically purchase, and the included measuring cup helps owners maintain consistent portion control — key for monitoring the weight of a large dog prone to joint stress if overweight. The stackable design keeps feeding stations organized and rodent-proof.</p>

<h3>Final Tips for Feeding Your Briard</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Divide meals:</strong> Feed your Briard twice daily rather than once to reduce the volume of food consumed at any one time, lowering bloat risk.</li>
  <li><strong>Rest after meals:</strong> Enforce a 30–60 minute rest period after eating before any vigorous exercise — a critical bloat prevention strategy for deep-chested breeds.</li>
  <li><strong>Dry the beard:</strong> Keep a dedicated towel near the feeding station to wipe your Briard's facial furnishings after every meal and water break, preventing skin irritation and odor.</li>
  <li><strong>Monitor weight:</strong> Use your storage container's measuring cup consistently. A healthy Briard should have a visible waist and ribs that are easily felt but not seen.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Training Basics</h2>

<p>Training a Briard is one of the most rewarding experiences in the dog world — and one that demands genuine engagement from the owner. This breed is not a passive recipient of commands. The Briard is intelligent, sensitive, and opinionated, with centuries of herding heritage that wired it to think independently, problem-solve on the fly, and make decisions without human direction. Harness that intelligence correctly and you will have an exceptionally capable companion. Ignore it, and the Briard will train you instead.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Briard Mind</h3>
<p>The AKC standard describes the Briard as having "a high degree of intelligence" and a certain independence that is characteristic of the breed. Unlike more handler-focused breeds such as Border Collies or Golden Retrievers, Briards were bred to work at a distance from shepherds, making judgment calls on their own. This means they are thinkers rather than automatic responders. A Briard may understand a command completely but pause to evaluate whether it makes sense in context before complying. New owners sometimes misread this as stubbornness; experienced Briard owners recognize it as the breed doing exactly what it was bred to do.</p>

<h3>Start Early, Start Right</h3>
<p>Begin socialization and basic training the day your Briard puppy arrives home — ideally between 8 and 12 weeks of age, when the socialization window is wide open. Exposure to a broad range of people, environments, sounds, other animals, and surfaces during this window has lifelong behavioral implications. Enroll in a puppy kindergarten class by 10–12 weeks (after appropriate vaccinations) to build social confidence and establish a foundation of human-directed learning.</p>

<p>Start with core commands: sit, stay, come, down, leave it, and leash manners. Keep sessions short — 5 to 10 minutes for young puppies, no more than 15–20 minutes for adolescents — and end on a positive note. Briards lose interest rapidly with repetitive, unchallenging drills and may begin testing limits if they're bored.</p>

<h3>Positive Reinforcement Works Best</h3>
<p>The Briard is highly sensitive — emotionally and physically. Harsh corrections, punishment-based methods, or heavy-handed training approaches are genuinely counterproductive with this breed. A Briard that is intimidated or confused by harsh handling is likely to shut down, become avoidant, or develop fear-based behaviors that are much harder to rehabilitate than the original training problem. Positive reinforcement — rewarding desired behaviors with treats, praise, or play — is not just kinder; it is more effective for this breed.</p>

<p>Use high-value rewards during early training, especially for recall and focus exercises. Cooked chicken, cheese, or commercial soft treats work well. As behaviors become reliable, gradually phase out food rewards in favor of intermittent reinforcement and praise.</p>

<h3>Leash Training and Herding Instinct</h3>
<p>Briards have a strong herding instinct that can manifest as nipping at heels, circling, or attempting to "gather" children, joggers, cyclists, or other pets. Early leash training that rewards loose-leash walking and redirects herding behaviors is critical. Teaching a solid "leave it" and reliable attention to name significantly reduces the likelihood of herding incidents in public settings. Do not punish herding attempts harshly — redirect calmly and consistently, and ensure your Briard has appropriate outlets for that instinct through organized herding trials or structured exercise.</p>

<h3>Advanced Training and Mental Stimulation</h3>
<p>Basic obedience is a starting point, not a finish line, for the Briard. This breed excels at competitive obedience, herding trials, agility, rally, Schutzhund, search and rescue, and service work. French military history even includes Briards serving as messenger and supply dogs in both World Wars. Channel that working intelligence into structured activities. A Briard that reaches advanced training levels — and many naturally do — is a significantly more balanced, satisfied dog than one confined to basic sit-and-stay exercises for its entire life.</p>

<h3>Consistency Above All</h3>
<p>Every member of the household must enforce the same rules, use the same commands, and maintain the same expectations. Briards are perceptive and will quickly identify and exploit inconsistency. Set clear boundaries from day one: whether the dog is allowed on furniture, how greetings are handled, and what behaviors at the door or during meals are acceptable. Changing the rules midstream creates confusion and erodes the trust that is foundational to a Briard's cooperation.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="behavior">
<h2>Common Behavioral Issues</h2>

<p>The Briard is not a breed that develops behavioral problems from malice or defiance. Nearly every significant behavioral challenge seen in this breed traces back to one or more of three root causes: insufficient mental stimulation, inadequate exercise, or mismanaged socialization. Understanding that context transforms behavior management from a battle of wills into a problem-solving exercise — one that plays to the Briard's natural strengths.</p>

<h3>Protective and Territorial Behavior</h3>
<p>The Briard is a natural guardian. Historically, these dogs protected flocks from predators and strangers, and that protective instinct remains strong in the modern breed. Without proper socialization and clear leadership, this instinct can escalate into excessive territorial behavior — aggressive barking at strangers, guarding the home intensely, or becoming reactive with unfamiliar dogs and people. This is arguably the most important behavioral issue to address proactively, beginning in puppyhood.</p>
<p>The solution is broad, structured socialization starting before 12 weeks and continuing throughout the first two years of life. Expose your Briard to a wide variety of people, environments, and social situations in controlled, positive contexts. A Briard that understands the difference between a genuine threat and an ordinary visitor is confident rather than reactive. One that has not been given that framework becomes a liability rather than an asset as a guardian.</p>

<h3>Herding and Nipping</h3>
<p>Many Briard owners — particularly those with children — encounter herding behaviors directed at family members. The dog circles, nudges, bumps, or nips at heels to "move" people, especially during excited moments like children playing or guests arriving. This behavior is deeply instinctual and not a sign of aggression, but it must be addressed firmly and early. Young children can be knocked over, and unchecked nipping can escalate.</p>
<p>Redirect herding behaviors to appropriate outlets — structured exercise, organized herding activities, or trick training that channels the dog's impulse to work. Teach "off" and "place" commands so you can interrupt herding sequences calmly and consistently. Never allow children and a herding-inclined Briard to interact unsupervised until the behavior is reliably under control.</p>

<h3>Velcro Behavior and Separation Anxiety</h3>
<p>Briards form deep, intense bonds with their families. This loyalty is one of the breed's most beloved traits — and also the source of one of its most common behavioral problems. Dogs that bond extremely closely with one person or family unit can develop true separation anxiety when left alone: destructive chewing, excessive vocalization, house soiling, or attempts to escape. Symptoms typically begin within 30 minutes of the owner's departure.</p>
<p>Prevention is far more effective than treatment. From puppyhood, practice brief departures and build your dog's tolerance for alone time gradually. Crate training helps enormously, giving the dog a secure, calm space when unsupervised. Mental enrichment before departure — a puzzle feeder, a stuffed Kong, a short training session — reduces anxiety significantly. Dogs with established separation anxiety benefit from a structured desensitization protocol, ideally guided by a certified behaviorist.</p>

<h3>Destructive Behavior and Boredom</h3>
<p>A Briard that does not receive adequate physical exercise (minimum 60–90 minutes daily for healthy adults) and mental stimulation will create its own entertainment — and you will not enjoy the results. Chewing furniture, digging, persistent barking, and inventing elaborate escape routes from the yard are all classic signs of an under-stimulated Briard. This breed was designed to work an 8-to-10-hour day alongside a shepherd. Without a meaningful outlet, that energy has to go somewhere.</p>
<p>Structure daily exercise sessions, incorporate obedience training into walks, provide puzzle toys and food-dispensing games, and consider enrolling in a dog sport. A Briard that has genuinely worked its body and mind each day is relaxed, cooperative, and pleasant company indoors.</p>

<h3>Barking</h3>
<p>Briards are alert and vocal dogs. They will announce visitors, flag unusual sounds, and communicate with their families through barking. This is normal and, in moderation, a desirable trait in a watchdog breed. However, without boundaries, barking can become excessive and difficult to manage. Teach a "quiet" command paired with positive reinforcement early. Never inadvertently reward barking by giving attention — even negative attention reinforces the behavior. Persistent nuisance barking typically signals a dog that is under-exercised, under-stimulated, or anxious.</p>

<h3>When to Seek Professional Help</h3>
<p>Most Briard behavioral issues respond well to consistent training and lifestyle adjustments. However, if your dog displays any of the following, consult a veterinarian to rule out medical causes, then seek a certified professional dog trainer (CPDT-KA) or board-certified veterinary behaviorist (DACVB):</p>
<ul>
  <li>Unprovoked aggression toward family members or familiar people</li>
  <li>Resource guarding that escalates to biting</li>
  <li>Severe separation anxiety that does not respond to basic intervention</li>
  <li>Fear responses so intense they impair the dog's daily quality of life</li>
  <li>Any sudden change in behavior in a previously well-adjusted dog</li>
</ul>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="socialization">
<h2>Socialization Guide</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large, powerful herding breed with a confident, sometimes dominant personality and deeply loyal instincts toward its family. While these traits make the Briard an exceptional companion and working dog, they also mean that early, consistent, and ongoing socialization is not optional — it is essential. A poorly socialized Briard can become suspicious of strangers, reactive toward other animals, and difficult to manage in public settings. A well-socialized one is a wonderfully adaptable, self-assured dog that takes new experiences in stride.</p>

<h3>The Critical Window: 3 to 16 Weeks</h3>
<p>The primary socialization window for any dog falls between 3 and 16 weeks of age, and for the Briard, this period carries enormous weight. Reputable Briard breeders will have already begun the process before puppies go home, exposing them to varied sounds, surfaces, people, and gentle handling. When you bring your Briard puppy home — typically around 8 weeks — your job is to build on that foundation immediately and enthusiastically.</p>
<p>During this window, aim to introduce your Briard puppy to at least:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>100 different people</strong> of varying ages, ethnicities, sizes, and appearances, including people in hats, uniforms, and glasses</li>
  <li><strong>Different surfaces</strong> — grass, gravel, tile, metal grates, wood decks, and wet pavement</li>
  <li><strong>Common household and outdoor sounds</strong> — vacuum cleaners, thunderstorms, traffic, crowds, and construction</li>
  <li><strong>Friendly, vaccinated dogs</strong> in controlled, positive settings</li>
  <li><strong>Livestock and other animals</strong> if relevant to your environment, given the breed's herding heritage</li>
</ul>

<h3>Socializing the Adolescent Briard</h3>
<p>Briards go through a notable adolescent phase, typically between 6 and 18 months, during which they may test boundaries and become more wary of unfamiliar people or situations — a trait common in guardian-type herding breeds. Do not back off socialization during this period. Continue attending puppy classes, visiting dog-friendly environments, and hosting visitors regularly. The Briard's natural wariness of strangers is a breed characteristic, not a flaw, but it must be shaped through positive exposure so it stays within appropriate limits.</p>
<p>Enroll your Briard in a structured puppy kindergarten class as soon as your veterinarian approves it, followed by a beginner obedience course. These group settings provide controlled socialization opportunities alongside foundational training — both critical for this intelligent, independent breed.</p>

<h3>Briards and Children</h3>
<p>Briards that are raised with children and properly socialized generally do very well with kids, showing a protective, playful side. However, their herding instinct can lead them to attempt to herd children — nipping at heels or nudging — which must be redirected early. Teach children how to interact respectfully with the dog, and supervise all interactions with very young children given the Briard's large size (55–100 lbs).</p>

<h3>Briards and Other Animals</h3>
<p>With early socialization, Briards can live peacefully with other dogs and even cats. However, they can be dominant with same-sex dogs, and their prey drive may surface around small animals. Introduce other pets slowly and carefully, always on leash initially. Briards raised with cats from puppyhood typically do well, but expect a management period of several weeks before trust is established.</p>

<h3>Ongoing Socialization for Adult Briards</h3>
<p>Socialization for a Briard doesn't end at 6 months or even 1 year. This breed benefits from lifelong exposure to new environments, people, and situations to maintain the confident, adaptable temperament it is capable of. Consider regular visits to pet-friendly stores, outdoor café patios, community events, and training club gatherings. A Briard that stays only in familiar environments can become increasingly territorial and reactive over time.</p>
<p>If you adopt an adult Briard, be patient but persistent. Work with a certified professional dog trainer or behaviorist to create a structured desensitization plan, especially if the dog shows fearfulness or reactivity. Most adult Briards can make significant progress with consistent effort and positive reinforcement methods.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="training-tools">
<h2>Recommended Training Tools</h2>

<p>The Briard is a working herding breed with centuries of independent decision-making bred into its DNA. Originally developed in France to both herd and guard flocks — sometimes for days without direct human supervision — the Briard is highly intelligent, sensitive, and capable of problem-solving on its own terms. This background makes the breed a rewarding but demanding training partner. Briards respond best to positive, reward-based methods delivered with consistency and patience. Harsh corrections backfire badly with this breed, producing stubbornness or withdrawal rather than compliance. Because Briards are also large, powerful dogs (60–100 lbs) with a wavy double coat, the right physical tools matter just as much as the right training philosophy. The products below are chosen specifically for the Briard's combination of sensitivity, intelligence, size, and coat type.</p>

<h3>Communication & Control</h3>

<p>Briards are attentive to their handler but can become distracted by their guarding instincts — especially in open spaces or around strangers. Clear communication tools help establish and reinforce the bond between Briard and owner during training sessions.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: PetSafe Gentle Leader Headcollar</div>
  <p>The Briard's herding heritage gives it powerful forward momentum, and an untrained Briard on a flat collar can be genuinely difficult to manage at 80+ pounds. The Gentle Leader redirects pulling at the head rather than the neck, giving handlers calm, effective control without the confrontational pressure that can shut a sensitive Briard down. Because it requires no jerking or physical corrections, it aligns perfectly with the positive-reinforcement approach this breed thrives under.</p>

  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Clicker Training Starter Kit with Wrist Band</div>
  <p>Briards are quick learners who pick up on patterns rapidly — which means the timing of your reward signal is critical. A clicker provides the precise, consistent marker that this intelligent breed needs to understand exactly which behavior earned the treat, accelerating learning in complex tasks like off-leash recalls and herding-pattern exercises. A wrist-band style clicker keeps your hands free, which is especially useful during the long coat grooming-and-handling desensitization sessions Briard puppies need.</p>

</div>

<h3>Reward & Motivation</h3>

<p>Food motivation varies in Briards — some are highly food-driven, others are more relationship-driven and respond better to play or praise. High-value treats are essential for building reliable behaviors, especially in the early stages of training or in distracting environments where the Briard's guarding instincts may compete with its attention.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Zuke's Mini Naturals Training Treats</div>
  <p>At just 3 calories per treat, Zuke's Minis allow Briard owners to deliver high-frequency rewards during long training sessions without overfeeding a breed that can trend toward weight gain in adulthood. The small size also means the Briard doesn't need to stop and chew — keeping focus and momentum high during complex behavior chains or distraction proofing exercises. The soft texture is gentle on younger dogs still developing their adult dentition.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: West Paw Zogoflex Tux Interactive Treat Toy</div>
  <p>The Briard is a working dog that needs mental stimulation as much as physical exercise — boredom is a primary driver of the breed's infamous stubbornness and destructive behavior. The Tux can be stuffed with high-value food like peanut butter or wet food and used as a jackpot reward after breakthrough training moments, or as a settle-and-calm exercise to teach the Briard self-regulation. Its durability holds up to the powerful jaws of a large, active herding dog.</p>

</div>

<h3>Long-Line & Off-Leash Training</h3>

<p>Because the Briard was bred to work independently at a distance from its handler, a solid recall is non-negotiable for this breed's safety. Long-line training bridges the gap between on-leash obedience and reliable off-leash freedom, giving the dog room to move while keeping the handler in control.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Mendota Products Long Snap Training Lead — 30 ft</div>
  <p>The Briard's thick, wavy coat can tangle badly in thin nylon long-lines, and the Mendota's round, braided construction resists wrapping and knotting even through a full double coat. At 30 feet, it gives Briards enough range to practice natural herding movement patterns and distance recalls without feeling tethered, while still allowing the handler to intervene if the dog's territorial instincts flare around strangers or unfamiliar animals. The snap clip is smooth and fast-release, important for a breed that can generate significant line tension.</p>

</div>

<h3>Mental Enrichment & Problem-Solving</h3>

<p>An under-stimulated Briard is a creative — and often destructive — Briard. This breed ranked among Napoleon's favorite working dogs precisely because of its problem-solving ability, and that capacity needs an outlet every single day.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Outward Hound Nina Ottosson Dog Brick Puzzle — Level 2</div>
  <p>The Briard's herding intelligence translates directly to puzzle-solving ability, and a Level 2 puzzle like the Dog Brick provides just enough challenge to be genuinely engaging without becoming so frustrating that the dog disengages — a real risk with the Briard's sensitive temperament. Used at the start or end of a training session, puzzle toys help establish the Briard's mental calm and focus, making it more receptive to learning. The removable compartments also allow you to incorporate training kibble, reducing mealtime boredom.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Note on Training Philosophy for Briards</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start young:</strong> Socialization and basic obedience before 16 weeks dramatically reduces the Briard's natural wariness of strangers developing into reactive guarding behavior.</li>
  <li><strong>Keep sessions short:</strong> 10–15 minutes of focused training outperforms 45-minute marathon sessions with this breed, which bores quickly once a concept is mastered.</li>
  <li><strong>Vary the rewards:</strong> Rotate between treats, tug play, and enthusiastic verbal praise to keep a Briard's interest — predictability breeds disengagement in this highly intelligent herder.</li>
  <li><strong>Work with the independence, not against it:</strong> Channel the Briard's problem-solving instincts into sports like herding trials, nose work, or agility rather than fighting them in the living room.</li>
</ul>

<section class="chapter" id="exercise">
<h2>Exercise Requirements</h2>

<p>The Briard is a working herding dog at heart, bred for long days moving livestock across French countryside terrain. This heritage translates into substantial exercise needs that prospective owners must take seriously. A Briard that doesn't get enough physical and mental stimulation will find its own outlets — typically destructive chewing, excessive barking, fence-pacing, or anxious behaviors. Meeting this breed's exercise requirements isn't a burden; it's the foundation of a happy life together.</p>

<h3>Daily Exercise Minimums</h3>
<p>Adult Briards require a minimum of <strong>60 to 90 minutes of vigorous exercise per day</strong>, ideally split across two sessions. This is not leisurely strolling — it should include activities that genuinely tax the dog physically. Many active Briard owners find that 2 hours of daily exercise produces the calm, settled dog they want at home. On lighter days, structured mental enrichment must compensate for reduced physical activity.</p>

<h3>Exercise by Life Stage</h3>
<p>Exercise requirements and appropriate activity types change significantly as your Briard grows:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Puppies (under 12 months):</strong> Limit forced, repetitive exercise to protect developing joints and growth plates. A common guideline is 5 minutes of structured exercise per month of age, twice daily (so a 4-month-old gets about 20 minutes per session). Free play in a safely fenced yard is generally fine and self-regulating.</li>
  <li><strong>Adolescents (12–24 months):</strong> Energy levels peak during this phase. Begin gradually increasing duration and intensity. Avoid high-impact jumping or extreme distances until your veterinarian confirms skeletal maturity.</li>
  <li><strong>Adults (2–7 years):</strong> Full exercise capacity. This is when the Briard truly shines as an athletic companion. Aim for 60–90+ minutes of vigorous activity daily.</li>
  <li><strong>Seniors (7+ years):</strong> Reduce intensity but maintain movement. Two 30-minute moderate walks daily, adjusted for any joint or health concerns, keeps older Briards mentally and physically healthy.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Types of Exercise the Briard Excels At</h3>
<p>The Briard's athleticism, intelligence, and desire to work make it well-suited for a wide range of exercise formats:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Off-leash running:</strong> A securely fenced area where a Briard can run freely and at full speed is enormously valuable. These dogs have impressive speed and endurance and love to stretch out and move.</li>
  <li><strong>Hiking and trail running:</strong> Briards are exceptional trail companions, capable of covering 10–15 miles on rugged terrain with a conditioned adult dog. Their double-layered coat provides protection in varied weather.</li>
  <li><strong>Fetch and structured play:</strong> Ball work, frisbee, and retrieve games satisfy both the physical drive and the breed's desire to engage with their person.</li>
  <li><strong>Swimming:</strong> Many Briards enjoy water and swimming provides excellent low-impact cardiovascular exercise, particularly beneficial for older dogs or those recovering from injury.</li>
  <li><strong>Dog sports:</strong> Agility, herding trials, tracking, and obedience competitions provide structured, high-quality exercise that also addresses the breed's mental needs (see Best Activities chapter for details).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Mental Exercise: The Often-Overlooked Component</h3>
<p>For a breed as intelligent as the Briard — frequently ranked among the most intelligent herding breeds — mental exercise is just as critical as physical exertion. A Briard that is physically tired but mentally bored will still be a problem dog. Incorporate the following into your weekly routine:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Training sessions of 10–15 minutes, 2–3 times daily, teaching new commands or reinforcing complex behaviors</li>
  <li>Puzzle feeders, snuffle mats, and interactive feeding toys at meal times</li>
  <li>Nose work and scent games — hiding treats or toys for the dog to locate</li>
  <li>Learning and practicing new tricks on a regular basis</li>
</ul>

<h3>Exercise in Hot Weather</h3>
<p>The Briard's thick, double-layered coat — which can reach 6 inches in length per AKC breed standards — means heat tolerance is limited. In temperatures above 80°F (27°C), shift exercise to early morning or evening hours, ensure constant access to fresh water, and watch carefully for signs of overheating including excessive panting, drooling, or lethargy. Never leave a Briard in a parked car. Despite the long coat, do not shave the Briard — the coat actually provides insulation in both directions and protects the skin from sunburn.</p>

<h2>Best Activities</h2>

<p>The Briard is one of the most versatile working dogs in existence, with a history that spans herding sheep across French hillsides, carrying messages through World War I trenches, serving as military sentries, and excelling in modern dog sports. This breed craves purpose, stimulation, and meaningful partnership with its owner. Finding the right activities for your Briard isn't just about burning energy — it's about honoring what this dog was built to do and deepening the bond between you.</p>

<h3>Herding</h3>
<p>Herding is the Briard's ancestral calling, and no activity connects more deeply with the breed's instincts and intelligence. Even Briards that have never seen livestock will often display immediate herding interest when introduced to sheep or ducks for the first time. The American Herding Breed Association (AHBA) and the AKC both offer herding instinct tests and formal trials. Participating in herding work — even casually — provides extraordinary mental and physical stimulation. Contact a local herding club to arrange an instinct evaluation for your Briard; many owners are surprised at how naturally their dog takes to it.</p>

<h3>AKC Herding Events</h3>
<p>The AKC offers a structured herding program with multiple titles available, from the Herding Tested (HT) entry level through advanced Herding Champion titles. For Briard owners interested in competitive herding, these trials are well worth pursuing. The breed is eligible for all AKC herding events and has a strong historical track record in the sport.</p>

<h3>Agility</h3>
<p>Agility is one of the most popular competitive sports for Briards, and it's easy to see why. These athletic, fast-thinking dogs take to the jumps, tunnels, weave poles, and contact obstacles with impressive enthusiasm. Agility also requires precise communication between handler and dog, which plays beautifully to the Briard's deep desire to work in partnership with its person. Look for a local agility club offering beginner classes; foundation skills can begin as early as 8 weeks with jump poles on the ground. AKC Agility trials are available to all eligible breeds, including the Briard.</p>

<h3>Obedience and Rally</h3>
<p>The Briard's intelligence makes it highly capable in formal obedience competition, though its independent streak means training must be engaging and positive to keep the dog motivated. AKC Obedience and Rally events offer titles from Beginner Novice through Utility Dog Excellent. Rally in particular — with its more relaxed, flowing format — tends to suit the Briard's personality well and is an excellent starting point for owners new to dog sports. Many Briards hold advanced obedience titles, reflecting the breed's genuine capability when properly motivated.</p>

<h3>Tracking and Nose Work</h3>
<p>Briards have excellent noses and a natural desire to use them. AKC Tracking offers titles (TD, TDU, TDX, VST) that test a dog's ability to follow aged scent trails across varied terrain — work that is deeply satisfying for this breed. AKC Scent Work, a newer sport modeled on detection dog training, is another excellent option. Nose work can be done at any age and fitness level, making it a wonderful activity for older Briards as well.</p>

<h3>Canine Good Citizen and Therapy Work</h3>
<p>Well-socialized Briards with calm temperaments can make excellent therapy dogs, bringing their warm, intuitive presence to hospitals, schools, and care facilities. The AKC Canine Good Citizen (CGC) certification is an excellent prerequisite and a worthwhile goal in itself. Because Briards form such strong bonds with humans and are highly perceptive of emotion — a trait that made them effective messenger dogs in wartime — they often excel in therapeutic environments.</p>

<h3>Backpacking and Hiking</h3>
<p>For owners who love the outdoors, the Briard is an exceptional trail companion. Fit adult Briards can carry a dog-specific pack with up to 25% of their body weight in supplies, making them genuinely useful on multi-day trips. Their coat protects against cold, wind, and brush, and their endurance is formidable. Always follow Leave No Trace principles, keep the dog leashed in wildlife-sensitive areas, and pack adequate water for both of you.</p>

<h3>Casual Activities for Every Household</h3>
<p>Not every Briard owner needs to compete in trials or trek mountain ranges. Enriching activities that work for everyday life include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Hide and seek</strong> — hiding in the house and calling your Briard to find you</li>
  <li><strong>Trick training</strong> — Briards learn new behaviors quickly and enjoy the mental challenge</li>
  <li><strong>Fetch and frisbee</strong> in a fenced yard</li>
  <li><strong>Structured neighborhood walks</strong> with varied routes, surfaces, and sniff time</li>
  <li><strong>Playdates</strong> with known, compatible dogs</li>
</ul>

<h2>Indoor vs. Outdoor Needs</h2>

<p>The Briard is unambiguously a family dog that belongs inside the home with its people. Despite its large size, working heritage, and impressive outdoor capability, this breed is deeply people-oriented and suffers when isolated or relegated to outdoor living. Understanding how to balance the Briard's need for substantial outdoor activity with its equal need for indoor companionship and mental engagement is key to raising a happy, stable dog.</p>

<h3>The Briard Is Not an Outside Dog</h3>
<p>This point deserves emphasis: Briards should not be kept primarily outdoors, in kennels, or in situations where they lack meaningful daily human contact. This is a breed that bonds intensely to its family and will develop anxiety, destructive behavior, excessive barking, or even aggression if left alone outdoors for extended periods. The Briard's protective instincts also mean that without proper social interaction and supervision, outdoor-only Briards can become territorially problematic — a challenge in any neighborhood setting.</p>
<p>Historically, Briards were not just herding dogs; they were companions to French shepherds who lived and worked alongside them. This legacy of close human partnership defines the breed's temperament to this day.</p>

<h3>Indoor Space Requirements</h3>
<p>Briards are large dogs — males typically weigh 75–100 lbs and stand 23–27 inches at the shoulder; females range from 55–75 lbs and 22–25.5 inches — and they do take up meaningful space. However, a properly exercised Briard is surprisingly calm indoors. An adult Briard that gets adequate daily exercise will spend much of its indoor time resting comfortably near family members, not bouncing off the walls.</p>
<p>Practical indoor considerations include:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Floor space:</strong> A large dog bed or orthopedic mat (at least 48 inches) is essential for proper rest. Briards often sprawl and need room to stretch.</li>
  <li><strong>Coat management:</strong> The Briard's long coat — described in AKC standards as "slightly wavy" with a harsh, dry texture — sheds moderately and requires regular grooming. Expect some hair on furniture and floors, and consider washable covers for sofas the dog has access to.</li>
  <li><strong>Counter surfing and reach:</strong> A large Briard can easily reach kitchen counters. Secure food and valuable items accordingly during the training period.</li>
  <li><strong>Crating:</strong> A 42–48 inch crate provides appropriate space for a Briard during early training and when unsupervised. Many adult Briards eventually earn free roaming privileges in a puppy-proofed home.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Outdoor Space: What's Ideal</h3>
<p>While the Briard can adapt to various living situations, access to a securely fenced yard makes life significantly easier for both dog and owner. The ideal setup includes:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>A securely fenced yard</strong> with a minimum fence height of 6 feet. Briards are athletic and determined; a 4-foot fence is typically insufficient for a motivated adult. Underground electric fences are generally not recommended for this breed, as the Briard's drive to investigate or chase can override the deterrent.</li>
  <li><strong>Shade and shelter:</strong> Always provide shaded areas outdoors. The Briard's thick coat means overheating is a genuine risk in warm weather.</li>
  <li><strong>Fresh water access:</strong> An outdoor water station is essential whenever the dog is spending time in the yard.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apartment or urban living is possible for a Briard but requires a significantly higher commitment to structured outdoor exercise — multiple daily walks, dog park visits, or access to off-leash areas — to compensate for the lack of yard space. Several accomplished Briard owners live successfully in cities, but they do so with a rigorous exercise schedule and strong training foundations.</p>

<h3>Climate Adaptability</h3>
<p>The Briard's double coat provides excellent insulation in cold weather, making the breed well-suited to northern climates and winter outdoor activity. Many Briards genuinely enjoy snow and cold temperatures. In warmer climates, the coat provides some heat protection, but owners in hot regions must be diligent about limiting outdoor activity during peak heat hours and never leaving the dog in direct sun without shade and water. Do not shave the coat in summer — despite popular belief, the coat regulates temperature in both directions and shaving can disrupt this function and cause coat damage.</p>

<h3>Supervision and Safety Outdoors</h3>
<p>Briards should not be left unsupervised in unfenced areas. Their herding instinct, protective nature, and curiosity about their environment mean they will explore, pursue, and potentially wander if given the opportunity. When hiking or in open spaces, keep your Briard on a leash unless in a designated off-leash area where the dog's reliable recall has been thoroughly tested. A Briard's recall must be trained proactively and consistently — it rarely develops reliably without deliberate effort.</p>

<h2>Exercise Gear</h2>

<h3>The Briard's Exercise Needs</h3>

<p>The Briard is an ancient French herding breed built for a full day's work across rugged terrain. Beneath that flowing, wavy double coat lies a powerfully athletic dog with extraordinary stamina, agility, and drive. Originally bred to herd and guard large flocks across the French countryside, the Briard needs far more than a daily stroll around the block — this breed demands vigorous, purposeful exercise to stay mentally balanced and physically healthy.</p>

<p>Adult Briards typically require <strong>60 to 90 minutes of active exercise per day</strong>, ideally split across two sessions. Without adequate physical and mental stimulation, this intelligent, high-energy breed can become destructive, anxious, or difficult to manage. The right exercise gear can make your sessions safer, more productive, and more enjoyable for both of you.</p>

<p>When selecting exercise gear for a Briard, keep these breed-specific factors in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Large, muscular build — gear must be sized and rated for a 70–100 lb working dog</li>
  <li>Dense, long coat that can snag in poorly designed harnesses or collars</li>
  <li>Strong herding instinct — reliable recall and control equipment is essential</li>
  <li>High endurance — gear should hold up to extended, multi-terrain workouts</li>
  <li>Sensitivity and intelligence — Briards respond best to positive reinforcement and fair handling</li>
</ul>

<h3>Control & Safety Equipment</h3>

<p>A Briard's herding instincts are strong, and these dogs can be independent thinkers on the move. Whether you're trail running, hiking, or working on obedience, reliable control gear is non-negotiable.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Ruffwear Front Range No-Pull Dog Harness</div>
  <p>The Briard's deep chest and muscular neck make a no-pull harness essential for leash walks and runs — a collar alone can put damaging pressure on their trachea during moments of herding-instinct-driven lunging. The Ruffwear Front Range features dual leash attachment points, padded chest and belly panels that won't mat or snag the Briard's long coat, and a load-bearing design built for large working dogs. The reflective trim is an added bonus for early-morning or dusk exercise sessions common with busy Briard owners.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Biothane Long Line Training Leash (30 ft)</div>
  <p>The Briard's recall must be rock-solid before off-leash exercise, and a long-line is the gold standard for building that reliability safely. Biothane long lines are ideal for Briards specifically because the waterproof, coated material won't absorb moisture or tangle in the breed's thick, feathered coat the way a rope or nylon line would. A 30-foot length gives your Briard room to run, sniff, and exhibit natural herding behaviors during controlled training sessions in open fields or parks.</p>

</div>

<h3>High-Energy Activity Gear</h3>

<p>Briards thrive when exercise has a job attached to it. Fetch, agility work, trail running, and structured play sessions tap into this breed's working heritage and satisfy both body and mind. The right equipment makes these activities safer and more effective.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Chuckit! Ultra Ball Launcher</div>
  <p>Fetch is one of the most efficient ways to burn through a Briard's considerable energy reserves, and a ball launcher lets you deliver longer, more consistent throws without fatiguing your arm during extended sessions. The Chuckit! Ultra Ball is made from high-bounce, durable rubber that stands up to the Briard's powerful jaws, while the launcher keeps you hands-free between throws — useful when managing a large, enthusiastic dog mid-session. Choose the large ball size to match the Briard's substantial mouth.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Ruffwear Palisades Dog Pack (Backpack)</div>
  <p>One of the best ways to satisfy a Briard's need for purposeful work is to give them a job on the trail — and a dog backpack does exactly that. The Ruffwear Palisades is designed for large, working-breed dogs and allows your Briard to carry their own water, collapsible bowl, and snacks on hikes, tapping directly into the breed's centuries-old drive to work alongside their owner. The padded, adjustable straps are designed to fit over a deep chest without restricting movement, and the pack's weight can be gradually increased as your Briard's fitness level grows.</p>

</div>

<h3>Recovery & Hydration</h3>

<p>Briards work hard, and that dense double coat means they can overheat more quickly than short-haired breeds during warm-weather exercise. Proper hydration and post-exercise recovery gear are important parts of a responsible exercise routine for this breed.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Ruffwear Bivy Dog Bowl (Collapsible Travel Bowl)</div>
  <p>Keeping a Briard properly hydrated during long exercise sessions is critical, especially given how much body heat that thick coat retains in warm weather. The Ruffwear Bivy is a collapsible, lightweight silicone bowl that clips directly to a harness, backpack, or your belt loop, making it practical for trail runs, agility sessions, and off-leash park visits. Its wide, shallow design makes it easy for a large-muzzled Briard to drink efficiently, and it holds enough water for a meaningful drink between bursts of activity.</p>
  <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=Ruffwear+Bivy+collapsible+dog+bowl&tag=onamzalikamci-20" class="product-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">View on Amazon</a>
</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Dog Cooling Mat (Large, Pressure-Activated)</div>
  <p>After a vigorous 90-minute session, a Briard's thick double coat holds body heat long after exercise ends — a pressure-activated cooling mat gives them a safe, comfortable place to regulate temperature without requiring refrigeration or water. Choose a large or extra-large size rated for dogs over 75 lbs to accommodate the Briard's substantial frame. Pairing post-exercise cool-down time on the mat with a calm routine helps reinforce the transition from high-drive working mode back to relaxed household companion — an important behavioral practice with this intense breed.</p>

</div>

<h3>A Note on Exercise Progression</h3>

<p>Briard puppies should <strong>not</strong> be over-exercised before 18 months of age, as their growth plates are still developing. Limit high-impact activities like long runs, jumping, and repetitive fetch sessions until your veterinarian confirms skeletal maturity. Short, frequent play sessions and leash walks are appropriate for puppies, while the full exercise regime outlined above is best reserved for adult Briards. As always, consult your vet if your Briard shows signs of joint stiffness or fatigue following exercise sessions — this breed's herding drive often means they will push through discomfort rather than self-limit.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="coat-care">
<h2>Coat Care & Brushing</h2>

<p>The Briard's magnificent double coat is arguably the breed's most defining feature — and its most demanding maintenance requirement. Described by the AKC standard as "coarse, hard, and dry" on the outer layer with a fine, tight undercoat, the Briard's coat can grow 6 inches or more in length and has a natural wave or slight curl. Without consistent grooming, this beautiful coat will mat quickly, turning from an asset into a source of discomfort and skin problems for your dog.</p>

<h3>Understanding the Briard Coat</h3>
<p>The Briard's coat grows continuously and does not shed heavily in the traditional sense, but it does shed loosely into the coat itself — meaning dead hair gets trapped rather than falling to the floor. This is great news for your furniture but means mats can form rapidly, especially in high-friction areas like behind the ears, under the collar, in the armpits, around the groin, and at the base of the tail. The coat is also moisture-retentive, so a wet Briard takes considerably longer to dry than short-coated breeds, and a damp coat left unbrushed is a recipe for dense matting.</p>

<h3>How Often Should You Brush a Briard?</h3>
<p>Plan on brushing your Briard a minimum of 2–3 times per week, with daily brushing being the gold standard for dogs kept in full coat. Working through the entire coat thoroughly can take 30–60 minutes per session even for experienced owners. Show dogs in full coat may require daily grooming sessions of an hour or more. If you find yourself unable to commit to this schedule, many Briard owners opt for a shorter "pet trim" that keeps the coat at 2–3 inches, dramatically reducing maintenance time without compromising the dog's comfort or character.</p>

<h3>Tools You'll Need</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Slicker brush:</strong> A large, firm-bristled slicker brush is your primary tool for line brushing the coat and removing loose hair.</li>
  <li><strong>Metal comb (wide and fine tooth):</strong> Essential for working through tangles and finishing the coat. A greyhound-style comb with both wide and narrow spacing is ideal.</li>
  <li><strong>Dematting tool or rake:</strong> For tackling early-stage mats before they become unmanageable.</li>
  <li><strong>Detangling spray:</strong> A light coat conditioner or detangling spray helps protect the coat and eases brush-through.</li>
  <li><strong>Pin brush:</strong> Useful for the beard, mustache, and facial furnishings, which are particularly prone to debris and tangles.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Brushing Technique: Line Brushing</h3>
<p>The most effective method for maintaining a Briard coat is called line brushing. Part the coat in sections and work from the skin outward in small areas, brushing each section thoroughly before moving on. Never brush only the surface of the coat — surface brushing looks tidy but leaves mats forming close to the skin undetected. Work methodically from the rear of the dog forward and from the bottom up. Use the metal comb as your final check; if the comb moves through any section of coat smoothly from skin to tip with no resistance, that area is truly mat-free.</p>

<h3>Dealing with Mats</h3>
<p>Act on mats as soon as you feel them — small tangles become dense, painful mats surprisingly quickly. Apply detangling spray and work the mat apart with your fingers first, then follow with a dematting comb. Split larger mats with the tip of a rat-tail comb or seam ripper before brushing out. Never try to pull a mat out with a brush in a single stroke; this is painful and damages the coat. If a mat is too close to the skin to safely work out, or covers a large area, clipping it out humanely is far preferable to prolonged pulling.</p>

<h3>Puppy Coat Transition</h3>
<p>Briard puppies have a soft, fluffy coat that transitions to the adult double coat typically between 12 and 18 months of age. This transition period is the most mat-prone phase of a Briard's life, as both coat types are present simultaneously. Daily brushing during this period is strongly recommended. Starting grooming sessions from the very first days at home, with short, positive sessions of 5–10 minutes, builds tolerance and even enthusiasm for grooming that will pay dividends for the dog's entire 12–14 year lifespan.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="bathing">
<h2>Bathing & Skin Care</h2>

<p>Bathing a Briard is a commitment — not a quick affair. Given the breed's dense, long double coat, a proper bath from wet-down to fully dry can take 3–4 hours or more, even for experienced owners. But regular bathing is essential for maintaining coat health, keeping the skin clear, and managing the distinctive "doggy smell" that the Briard's coat can accumulate. Most pet Briards do well with a bath every 4–8 weeks, while show dogs may be bathed more frequently depending on the show schedule.</p>

<h3>Before the Bath: Brush First</h3>
<p>This rule is non-negotiable: always brush and fully demat the coat before bathing. Water causes mats to tighten and shrink, turning a manageable tangle into a near-impossible knot. Spend the time to line-brush the entire coat before your Briard gets anywhere near the tub. Check behind the ears, under the legs, and around the collar especially carefully. Bathing a mat-free Briard is a much more pleasant experience for both of you.</p>

<h3>Shampoo and Conditioner Selection</h3>
<p>Choose a shampoo formulated for long-coated or double-coated breeds. The Briard coat responds well to moisturizing or conditioning shampoos that soften the outer coat slightly without making it limp or overly soft. Avoid harsh clarifying or degreasing shampoos for routine baths, as they can strip the coat's natural oils and cause dryness and skin irritation. A leave-in conditioner or a diluted rinse-out conditioner used after shampooing significantly eases the drying and brushing process and reduces static. Budget $20–$50 for quality professional-grade shampoo and conditioner products.</p>

<h3>Bathing Technique</h3>
<p>Thoroughly soak the coat before applying shampoo — this takes longer than you'd expect given the coat's density. Use lukewarm water and work shampoo through the coat in the direction of hair growth, massaging down to the skin. Pay special attention to the beard and mustache, which trap food, water, and debris daily. Rinse extremely thoroughly; shampoo residue left in the dense undercoat causes skin irritation and itching. Many Briard owners rinse twice to be certain all product is removed. Apply conditioner, allow it to sit for 2–5 minutes, and rinse again completely.</p>

<h3>Drying a Briard</h3>
<p>Drying is arguably the most time-intensive part of the process. Begin by gently squeezing (not rubbing, which causes tangles) excess water from the coat using your hands and then absorbent towels. Using a high-velocity force dryer — available for around $100–$300 — dramatically speeds the drying process and simultaneously blows loose hair out of the coat. Work section by section with a slicker brush as you dry. Never allow your Briard to air-dry without brushing; the coat will dry into waves and tangles that are difficult to correct. A Briard that has been force-dried and brushed to completion has a noticeably fuller, cleaner, and more impressive coat.</p>

<h3>Skin Care Considerations</h3>
<p>The Briard's dense coat can mask skin conditions that would be immediately visible on a short-coated breed. Make it a habit to part the coat and visually inspect the skin during each grooming session. Look for redness, flaking, hot spots, unusual odor, or signs of parasites. Hot spots (acute moist dermatitis) can develop rapidly under the dense coat, especially in warm, humid weather or after the coat has been wet and not fully dried. If you notice excessive scratching, head shaking, or any skin abnormality, consult your veterinarian promptly. Briards are not a breed known for unusual skin sensitivities, but no dense-coated dog is immune to skin issues if grooming is neglected.</p>

<h3>Ear Canal Care During Bathing</h3>
<p>Place a cotton ball loosely in each ear canal before bathing to prevent water from entering the ear canal. The Briard's drop ears and the dense hair inside and around the ear create a warm, moist environment that is conducive to yeast and bacterial ear infections. After bathing, remove the cotton balls and gently dry around the ear flaps and the outer ear canal with a dry towel.</p>

<h3>Professional Grooming</h3>
<p>Many Briard owners, particularly those with pet-trimmed dogs, use professional groomers every 8–12 weeks. Expect to pay $80–$150 or more for a full groom on a Briard given the time involved. Finding a groomer with specific large breed or herding breed experience is worthwhile — ask about their familiarity with double-coated breeds before booking.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="nail-ear-dental">
<h2>Nail, Ear & Dental Care</h2>

<p>Beyond coat maintenance, Briards require consistent attention to nails, ears, and teeth to stay healthy and comfortable. These "small" maintenance tasks are easy to deprioritize during a lengthy grooming session, but neglecting them leads to real health consequences — from painful overgrown nails that affect gait, to chronic ear infections, to dental disease that shortens lifespan. Build these checks into every grooming session as non-negotiable routine.</p>

<h3>Nail Care</h3>
<p>Briards have dark nails, which makes trimming more challenging than on breeds with light nails where the quick is clearly visible. Most Briards need nail trimming every 3–4 weeks. A good rule of thumb: if you can hear the nails clicking on hard flooring, they're overdue for a trim. Overgrown nails force the toes into an unnatural position, ultimately affecting posture and gait — a particular concern in a working herding breed.</p>

<p>Use a quality guillotine-style or scissor-style nail clipper appropriate for a medium-to-large breed dog, or a rotary grinding tool for dogs who find clipping stressful. Trim small amounts at a time when working with dark nails, looking for a chalky white or grey circle at the center of the cut surface — this indicates you're approaching the quick. Keep styptic powder on hand in case of accidental quick cuts. If your Briard is active on pavement or hard surfaces, natural wear may reduce how frequently trimming is needed.</p>

<p>Don't forget the dewclaws — Briards characteristically have double dewclaws on the hind legs, which is actually a breed requirement per the AKC standard. These double rear dewclaws are a defining trait of the Briard and are never removed. Because they don't contact the ground, they grow rapidly and can curl into the leg if ignored. Check and trim dewclaws at every nail-trimming session without exception.</p>

<h3>Ear Care</h3>
<p>The Briard's pendant (drop) ears, combined with the dense hair that grows both inside and around the ear canal, creates conditions favorable for moisture retention and poor air circulation — the primary contributors to yeast and bacterial ear infections. Weekly ear checks should be part of your routine.</p>

<p>During each check, gently lift the ear flap and look into the canal. A healthy ear is pale pink, odor-free, and has minimal wax or debris. Signs of infection include redness, dark or excessive discharge, a distinctly yeasty or foul odor, and scratching at the ears or head shaking. Clean the visible outer ear canal with a veterinarian-recommended ear cleaning solution and cotton balls — never cotton swabs, which can push debris deeper and risk damaging the eardrum.</p>

<p>Many Briard owners and groomers remove hair from inside the ear canal to improve airflow. This is a somewhat debated practice — some veterinary dermatologists recommend it for infection-prone ears, others suggest it can cause minor inflammation. Discuss the appropriate approach for your individual dog with your veterinarian. At minimum, keep the hair trimmed short around the outer ear opening.</p>

<h3>Dental Care</h3>
<p>Dental disease is the most commonly diagnosed health condition in dogs overall, affecting an estimated 80% of dogs by age three. Briards are not exempt, and the consequences of periodontal disease extend beyond bad breath — bacteria from the mouth enter the bloodstream and can contribute to heart, kidney, and liver disease over time.</p>

<p>Daily toothbrushing is the gold standard and the single most effective home dental care measure. Use a toothbrush designed for dogs or a finger brush with enzymatic dog-safe toothpaste (never human toothpaste, which contains xylitol and fluoride, both toxic to dogs). Even brushing 3–4 times per week provides meaningful protection compared to no brushing at all. Start toothbrushing in puppyhood and make it a positive, reward-based routine from the beginning.</p>

<p>Dental chews, water additives, and dental toys approved by the Veterinary Oral Health Council (VOHC) can supplement brushing but should not replace it. Professional dental cleanings under anesthesia are typically recommended by veterinarians every 1–2 years, depending on the individual dog's dental health status. These cleanings run $300–$700 or more depending on location and whether extractions are required. Consistent home care significantly reduces how often professional cleanings are needed.</p>

<h3>Building a Maintenance Schedule</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Daily:</strong> Toothbrushing, quick beard and eye area cleanup</li>
  <li><strong>Weekly:</strong> Full coat brushing (minimum), ear inspection and cleaning if needed</li>
  <li><strong>Monthly:</strong> Nail trimming including double dewclaws, detailed skin check during brushing</li>
  <li><strong>Every 4–8 weeks:</strong> Full bath and blow-dry</li>
  <li><strong>Every 8–12 weeks:</strong> Professional groom trim (for pet-trimmed dogs)</li>
  <li><strong>Annually:</strong> Veterinary dental exam; professional cleaning as recommended</li>
</ul>

<h2>Grooming Tools & Products</h2>

<h3>Understanding the Briard Coat</h3>

<p>The Briard is a breed defined by its coat — a long, wavy, double-layered mantle of fur that can reach six inches or more in length when fully mature. This magnificent coat was designed by nature to protect a working herding dog from harsh weather, thorns, and rough terrain. But that same coat demands serious, consistent grooming from its owner. Without regular maintenance, a Briard's coat will mat quickly and deeply — especially behind the ears, in the armpits, around the collar line, and along the legs where friction is constant.</p>

<p>The Briard's outer coat is coarse and slightly dry in texture, which actually helps resist minor tangles when properly maintained. The undercoat is fine and dense. Together, they create a system that sheds moderately year-round with heavier shedding seasons in spring and fall. The good news is that Briards do not require professional grooming as frequently as some other long-coated breeds — but only if the owner commits to brushing sessions two to three times per week at minimum, and daily during peak shedding periods.</p>

<p>Successful Briard grooming relies on having the right tools. Using the wrong brush on this coat wastes time and causes unnecessary discomfort for the dog. Below are the specific tools and products best suited to keeping a Briard's coat healthy, tangle-free, and looking its best.</p>

<h3>Detangling & Brushing Tools</h3>

<p>The foundation of any Briard grooming routine is a reliable slicker brush and a long-toothed pin brush used in combination. Working in sections, brush down to the skin — not just across the surface — to catch developing mats before they tighten and become painful. Always brush before bathing, as water tightens knots significantly.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Chris Christensen Big G Slicker Brush</div>
  <p>The Chris Christensen Big G is a professional-grade slicker brush designed specifically for long, dense coats — making it an ideal match for the Briard's thick, wavy fur. Its extra-long, flexible pins penetrate deep into the Briard's double coat without scratching the skin, pulling out loose undercoat and smoothing the outer layer simultaneously. The large paddle head covers significant surface area per stroke, cutting grooming time considerably on a breed whose coat demands thorough, methodical brushing sessions.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Andis Premium Large Pin Brush</div>
  <p>A quality pin brush is essential for finishing work on the Briard's coat after the slicker brush has done the heavy lifting. The Andis Premium Pin Brush features ball-tipped, stainless steel pins set in a cushioned base, which glide through the Briard's long outer coat without breaking or splitting the coarse hair strands. This brush is particularly effective for fluffing and separating the coat along the legs, chest, and tail — areas where the Briard's coat is especially prone to forming flat, compressed sections.</p>

</div>

<h3>Mat Removal Tools</h3>

<p>Even with diligent brushing, Briards are prone to developing mats — particularly in high-friction zones like the armpits, groin, and behind the ears. Having a dedicated dematting tool on hand allows owners to address problem areas before they require scissor intervention or professional help.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Safari De-Matting Comb for Dogs</div>
  <p>The Safari De-Matting Comb uses serrated stainless steel blades to carefully cut through and loosen mats in the Briard's coat without removing healthy surrounding fur. This is critical for a breed whose coat takes considerable time to grow and should be preserved whenever possible. The ergonomic handle provides the control needed to work slowly through stubborn tangles, and the blade design minimizes the tugging sensation that can make mat removal stressful for sensitive dogs during grooming sessions.</p>

</div>

<h3>Bathing & Coat Care Products</h3>

<p>Briards should be bathed every four to six weeks under normal circumstances, or more frequently if they've been working outdoors and picked up debris in their coat. Because the Briard's outer coat is naturally coarser and drier than many other breeds, a moisturizing or conditioning shampoo is strongly recommended to prevent brittleness and breakage. Always follow with a conditioner or detangling spray, which makes post-bath brushing dramatically easier.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Bio-Groom Super Cream Conditioner</div>
  <p>Bio-Groom Super Cream is a leave-in or rinse-out conditioner favored by professional handlers of long-coated breeds, making it perfectly suited to the Briard's demanding coat. It significantly reduces static and surface friction in the Briard's coarse outer coat, which in turn reduces tangling between grooming sessions. Applied after bathing, it softens the coat just enough to make thorough brushing more comfortable for the dog while preserving the natural texture that gives the Briard its characteristic rustic appearance.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: The Stuff Detangler & Conditioner Spray</div>
  <p>A quality detangling spray is arguably the single most useful everyday grooming product a Briard owner can keep on hand. The Stuff Detangler spray can be lightly misted onto dry or damp sections of the Briard's coat before and between brushing sessions to dramatically reduce resistance and protect the hair shaft from breakage. This is especially valuable when working through the dense beard and eyebrow furnishings on the Briard's face — areas that mat quickly from food and moisture contact and require frequent, gentle attention.</p>

<h3>Grooming Tips Specific to the Briard</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Start young:</strong> Briard puppies should be introduced to brushing, ear handling, and paw touching from the earliest weeks possible. This breed is intelligent and strong-willed — making grooming cooperation a learned habit, not an afterthought.</li>
  <li><strong>Work in sections:</strong> Never brush the entire coat in broad strokes. Part the coat into layers and brush from the skin outward to ensure every level of the double coat is addressed.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the double dewclaws:</strong> Briards famously carry double dewclaws on their hind legs — a breed-defining trait. Keep the fur around these dewclaws trimmed and check regularly for matting and nail overgrowth, which can cause discomfort or injury if neglected.</li>
  <li><strong>Ear maintenance:</strong> The Briard's drop ears create a warm, humid environment prone to infection. Clean ears monthly and check for early signs of redness or odor.</li>
  <li><strong>Professional trims:</strong> Even owners who handle the majority of grooming at home benefit from professional scissor trims around the paws, ears, and sanitary areas every eight to twelve weeks.</li>
</ul>

<section class="chapter" id="home-setup">
<h2>Home Setup</h2>

<p>The Briard is a large, intelligent, and energetic French herding breed with a distinctive long, wavy double coat and a famously loyal — sometimes velcro-like — personality. Originally bred to herd and guard flocks across vast French countryside, Briards carry a strong working drive, exceptional intelligence, and a deep need for both physical activity and mental stimulation. Setting up your home correctly for a Briard isn't just about comfort — it's about creating an environment that meets the demands of a high-energy, deeply bonded working dog who will absolutely notice (and protest) when their needs aren't met.</p>

<p>Briards are large dogs, typically weighing between 55 and 100 pounds, with a coat that requires serious maintenance. They thrive with space to move, outlets for their herding instincts, and a secure, defined space to call their own. Their protective nature also means they are highly alert to their environment, so thoughtful home setup can reduce anxiety and unwanted guarding behaviors. Here's what your home needs before your Briard arrives.</p>

<h3>Rest and Recovery: Giving Your Briard a Proper Bed</h3>

<p>Despite their tireless work ethic, Briards need a dedicated, comfortable resting space. As a large breed, they are prone to joint stress, particularly in the elbows and hips, and a quality orthopedic bed becomes increasingly important as they age. Because Briards are deeply loyal and tend to follow their owners everywhere, placing a bed in the main living area — rather than isolating them — also helps reduce separation anxiety.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Big Barker 7" Orthopedic Dog Bed (Large/XL)</div>
  <p>The Big Barker's thick orthopedic foam is specifically engineered for large breeds, making it ideal for a Briard's substantial frame and active lifestyle. The durable, easy-to-clean cover handles the shedding and dirt that comes with a long double coat, and the elevated foam base reduces pressure on joints after long herding-style play sessions or hikes. Its low-profile design also works well for Briards who prefer to flop down quickly rather than climb onto raised surfaces.</p>

</div>

<h3>Containment and Safety: Crates and Exercise Pens</h3>

<p>Briard puppies and adolescents — and even some adults — can be destructive when bored or anxious. Crate training gives your Briard a safe, den-like space that satisfies their instinct for a defined territory. Because Briards are large and strong, a heavy-duty crate is essential; flimsy wire crates won't stand up to a determined, under-stimulated Briard. An exercise pen is also valuable for giving puppies a larger but still controlled space to move during the day.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: MidWest Homes for Pets XX-Large Double Door Dog Crate (54 inch)</div>
  <p>The 54-inch MidWest double-door crate is large enough to comfortably house an adult Briard, and its dual-door design allows flexible placement in various rooms — important for a breed that needs to feel connected to the household. The divider panel included in the kit is especially useful for Briard puppies, allowing you to expand the space as they grow rather than purchasing a second crate. The fold-flat design also makes it easy to transport, which suits Briards who travel with their owners to dog sports or herding trials.</p>

</div>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: IRIS USA 24-inch Exercise Pen for Dogs (8 Panel)</div>
  <p>Briard puppies need space to move without having access to the entire home before they're reliably trained — and this sturdy 8-panel pen creates a safe zone that can be configured in multiple shapes to suit your living space. The panels are tall enough to contain an energetic Briard puppy and can be connected to the crate to form a larger puppy zone during the day. This setup is especially useful for Briard owners who work from home and need the puppy nearby but safely contained.</p>

</div>

<h3>Grooming Station Essentials</h3>

<p>The Briard's hallmark coat — long, slightly wavy, and with a fine undercoat — is one of the breed's most striking features, but it requires consistent grooming to prevent painful matting. Without regular brushing, the coat can develop tight mats close to the skin that are difficult and uncomfortable to remove. Establishing a grooming routine early and having the right tools within reach at home is non-negotiable for this breed.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: Chris Christensen Long Pin Slicker Brush</div>
  <p>The Chris Christensen long-pin slicker brush is widely considered the gold standard for long-coated breeds, and the Briard's dense, flowing coat is exactly what it was designed for. The long pins reach through the outer coat to gently detangle the undercoat without breaking hair or causing discomfort — critical for maintaining the Briard's texture and preventing mat formation near the skin. Regular use of this brush, ideally several times a week, will dramatically reduce the time spent on coat maintenance and help Briards associate grooming with a positive, low-stress experience.</p>

</div>

<h3>Mental Enrichment: Keeping That Herding Brain Busy</h3>

<p>A bored Briard is a destructive Briard. This breed was developed to make independent decisions while managing flocks, which means they have an active, problem-solving mind that needs daily engagement. Puzzle feeders, interactive toys, and scent games are essential components of a well-set-up Briard home — not optional extras. Mental fatigue from enrichment activities can be just as effective as physical exercise for settling a restless Briard.</p>

<div class="product-box">
  <div class="product-box-title">Recommended: West Paw Toppl Treat Dispensing Dog Toy (Large)</div>
  <p>The West Paw Toppl is a durable, dishwasher-safe enrichment toy that can be stuffed with kibble, wet food, or treats and frozen to extend challenge time — perfect for a Briard's persistent, food-motivated problem-solving. Its wide opening makes it easy to stuff with a variety of textures, which keeps the experience fresh and mentally engaging for a breed that quickly learns to "solve" simpler toys. Two Toppls connected together create an even more complex puzzle that can occupy a mentally sharp Briard for extended periods.</p>

</div>

<h3>Final Thoughts on Setting Up for a Briard</h3>

<p>Bringing a Briard home is a commitment to an intelligent, active, and deeply devoted companion who will be aware of — and involved in — everything happening in your household. The right home setup respects both their physical size and their mental complexity. Prioritize a supportive bed for their joints, a secure and appropriately sized crate for safe containment, professional-grade grooming tools for that magnificent coat, and daily enrichment to keep their working-dog brain satisfied. A well-set-up home means a calmer, more confident Briard — and a far more harmonious life together.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="traveling">
<h2>Traveling With Your Dog</h2>

<p>Briards are loyal, adaptable companions who tend to travel well once properly introduced to the experience. As a working herding breed with a strong bond to their family, most Briards prefer the discomfort of travel to being left behind. Whether you're planning a road trip, a vacation rental, or navigating air travel, understanding the Briard's specific needs and characteristics will make the journey smoother for everyone involved.</p>

<h3>Car Travel</h3>
<p>The Briard's size — typically 55–100 pounds and standing 22–27 inches at the shoulder — means this is a dog who takes up space in a vehicle. For safety and comfort, the best options are a secured, appropriately sized crate in the cargo area of an SUV or hatchback, or a dog seatbelt harness in the rear seat. Unsecured dogs are a safety hazard in sudden stops and are at serious risk of injury in accidents. The FMVSS-certified crash-tested harness and crate market has expanded considerably; expect to invest $60–$200 for a quality safety solution appropriate to the Briard's size.</p>

<p>The Briard's dense coat is a consideration in warm weather travel. Never leave a Briard — or any dog — in a parked vehicle in warm weather. Even on a mild 70°F day, car interiors can reach dangerous temperatures within minutes. On long drives, plan stops every 2 hours for water, a short walk, and a bathroom break. Keep the vehicle cool with air conditioning, and consider a cooling mat or wet towel for the dog's resting area in summer months.</p>

<h3>Crate Training for Travel</h3>
<p>A Briard who accepts a crate as a comfortable den makes travel dramatically easier. Introduce crate training early in puppyhood with positive associations — meals fed in the crate, favored toys inside, and gradually increasing duration. An adult Briard who views the crate as their safe space will settle quickly during long car rides and in unfamiliar environments. For a dog of the Briard's size, a 42–48 inch crate is typically appropriate.</p>

<h3>Air Travel</h3>
<p>Due to their size, Briards cannot travel in the cabin of commercial aircraft and would need to fly as checked baggage or cargo — a stressful and potentially risky option that most owners and breed enthusiasts advise against. The risk of heat injury, anxiety, and physical injury in cargo is non-trivial. If you must fly with a Briard, research airlines carefully, only fly during cooler weather and on direct flights, and consult your veterinarian about preparation strategies. Many Briard owners instead arrange trusted pet-sitters, experienced dog boarders familiar with large herding breeds, or reciprocal arrangements with fellow Briard owners when air travel is necessary.</p>

<h3>Accommodation</h3>
<p>The Briard's size and sometimes dramatic appearance can make finding pet-friendly accommodations a challenge. Many hotels impose weight limits of 25–50 pounds, immediately excluding the average Briard. Focus your search on pet-friendly vacation rental platforms, boutique hotels, or national park cabins that explicitly welcome large dogs. Always call ahead to confirm the specific pet policy rather than relying solely on online listings. Budget for pet fees — these commonly range from $25–$75 per night or a flat $100–$200 stay fee.</p>

<p>In rental accommodations, be proactive about Briard-specific considerations: bring their crate as their designated sleep and rest space to avoid issues with dog hair on furniture, bring a familiar blanket or bed to ease the transition to a new environment, and consider bringing a baby gate to restrict access to areas where the landlord may have concerns.</p>

<h3>Managing the Briard's Protective Instincts</h3>
<p>Briards are naturally alert, somewhat suspicious of strangers, and strongly protective of their family — traits that make them outstanding working dogs but that require management in travel situations. A Briard encountering a busy hotel lobby, crowded rest stop, or unfamiliar trail may be more reactive than usual. Keep your Briard on a secure leash at all times in unfamiliar environments. Use calm, confident body language to signal that new situations are safe. Socialization throughout the dog's life pays enormous dividends during travel — a well-socialized Briard adapts to novel environments far more easily than one with limited exposure.</p>

<h3>Packing for Your Briard</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Enough food for the full trip plus two extra days' supply</li>
  <li>Familiar water (or bottled water to avoid GI upset from different water sources)</li>
  <li>Portable water bowl and collapsible food dish</li>
  <li>Grooming kit — at minimum a slicker brush and metal comb for daily maintenance</li>
  <li>Proof of vaccination and veterinary health certificate if crossing state or international lines</li>
  <li>Copies of medical records and current medications</li>
  <li>Your veterinarian's contact information and the number for a 24-hour emergency vet near your destination</li>
  <li>A well-fitting harness and two sturdy leashes</li>
  <li>Familiar bedding or a crate blanket</li>
  <li>Waste bags, paper towels, and a pet-safe enzymatic cleaner for accidents</li>
</ul>

<h3>Keeping Routines Intact</h3>
<p>The Briard is an intelligent, sensitive breed that notices and responds to changes in routine. Keeping feeding times, exercise routines, and bedtime rituals as consistent as possible during travel reduces anxiety and keeps behavior stable. A well-exercised Briard — plan on a minimum of 45–60 minutes of activity per day even while traveling — is a calmer, more content travel companion. Research dog-friendly parks, trails, and beaches at your destination before departure so exercise opportunities are planned rather than improvised.</p>
</section>

<section class="chapter" id="cost">
<h2>Cost of Ownership</h2>

<p>The Briard is a breed that rewards its owners handsomely, but that reward comes with a real financial commitment. From the initial purchase price to ongoing grooming and healthcare, prospective owners should budget carefully before bringing home one of these magnificent sheepdogs. Here's a realistic breakdown of what you can expect to spend over a Briard's lifetime.</p>

<h3>Puppy Price and Acquisition Costs</h3>
<p>A well-bred Briard puppy from a reputable breeder typically costs between <strong>$1,500 and $3,500</strong>, with show-quality or working-line puppies from champion bloodlines sometimes reaching $4,000 or more. Breeders who health-test their breeding stock for hip dysplasia, progressive retinal atrophy (PRA), and stationary night blindness (SNB) — conditions the breed is prone to — will charge more, and rightly so. That investment in ethical breeding pays off in fewer veterinary bills down the road.</p>
<p>If you choose to adopt through a Briard rescue organization such as the Briard Club of America's rescue network, adoption fees typically run <strong>$200 to $500</strong>. Keep in mind that Briards in rescue may need extra patience and training investment.</p>

<h3>Initial Setup Costs</h3>
<p>The first year is always the most expensive. Beyond the purchase price, budget for the following one-time and startup costs:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Spay/neuter surgery:</strong> $200–$500</li>
  <li><strong>Initial vet exam, vaccines, and microchip:</strong> $150–$300</li>
  <li><strong>Crate (large/XL):</strong> $80–$200</li>
  <li><strong>Quality leash, collar, and harness:</strong> $50–$100</li>
  <li><strong>Dog bed or orthopedic mat:</strong> $60–$150</li>
  <li><strong>Food and water bowls:</strong> $20–$50</li>
  <li><strong>Puppy obedience classes:</strong> $100–$300</li>
  <li><strong>Grooming tools (slicker brushes, detangling comb, mat splitter):</strong> $50–$150</li>
</ul>
<p>Expect total first-year costs — including the puppy price — to land somewhere between <strong>$3,000 and $7,000</strong> depending on your location and choices.</p>

<h3>Food Costs</h3>
<p>Briards are large dogs, with males weighing 75–100 pounds and females 50–75 pounds. A high-quality large-breed dry kibble or raw diet will cost approximately <strong>$60–$120 per month</strong>, or $720–$1,440 per year. Active working Briards or those in herding sports may need higher-calorie diets, pushing costs toward the upper end of that range.</p>

<h3>Grooming Costs</h3>
<p>The Briard's long, wavy double coat is one of the most demanding aspects of ownership. Without regular brushing — ideally several times per week — the coat can mat severely, and full dematting by a groomer can be both expensive and stressful for the dog. Professional grooming appointments every 6–8 weeks typically cost <strong>$80–$150 per session</strong>, adding up to <strong>$600–$1,200 per year</strong>. Many Briard owners learn to do significant maintenance grooming themselves to reduce this expense, but professional trims are still recommended a few times annually.</p>

<h3>Veterinary and Health Costs</h3>
<p>Routine annual vet care — including wellness exams, vaccinations, heartworm testing, and flea/tick prevention — runs approximately <strong>$400–$700 per year</strong>. Briards are predisposed to several heritable conditions including hip and elbow dysplasia, bloat (GDV), and eye conditions like PRA and congenital stationary night blindness. Orthopedic surgeries for hip dysplasia can cost <strong>$3,500–$7,000 per hip</strong>, and emergency bloat surgery (gastropexy) can run <strong>$2,000–$5,000</strong>.</p>
<p>Pet insurance is strongly recommended for Briard owners. Monthly premiums for a comprehensive plan typically range from <strong>$50–$100</strong>, depending on your deductible and coverage level.</p>

<h3>Training and Enrichment</h3>
<p>Briards are intelligent, independent thinkers that benefit enormously from ongoing training. Beyond puppy classes, many owners invest in intermediate obedience, herding clinics, or dog sports like agility or nose work. Budget <strong>$200–$600 per year</strong> for continued training, enrichment toys, and puzzle feeders.</p>

<h3>Lifetime Cost Estimate</h3>
<p>Over a Briard's average lifespan of 12 years, total ownership costs — including purchase price — commonly fall between <strong>$25,000 and $45,000</strong>, depending on health, grooming choices, and lifestyle. It's a significant commitment, but for the right owner, every dollar spent on this loyal, spirited breed is well worth it.</p>

<section class="chapter" id="tips">
<h2>Breed-Specific Tips</h2>

<p>The Briard is not a breed for the casual dog owner. Behind that stunning, shaggy exterior is a highly intelligent, emotionally complex working dog that has been guarding flocks — and deeply bonding with its family — for centuries. These tips are tailored specifically to the Briard's unique temperament, physical needs, and quirks, drawn from the experience of longtime breed enthusiasts and working dog handlers.</p>

<h3>Embrace the "Velcro Dog" Reality</h3>
<p>Briards are famously devoted to their families, sometimes described as having "a heart of gold beneath a rough exterior." They tend to be intensely bonded to their people and do not thrive when left alone for long periods. If you work long hours away from home, plan for a dog walker, doggy daycare, or a canine companion. Separation anxiety is a real risk in under-socialized or isolated Briards, and it often manifests as destructive behavior or nuisance barking.</p>

<h3>Start Socialization Early — And Keep Going</h3>
<p>The Briard's herding and guardian heritage means it can be aloof or wary of strangers and protective of its territory. Early, consistent socialization starting at 8 weeks is not optional — it's essential. Expose your Briard puppy to a wide variety of people (including children, men with hats, and uniformed workers), animals, vehicles, and environments. The critical socialization window closes around 14–16 weeks, so make the most of it. Ongoing socialization throughout adolescence helps prevent the breed's natural wariness from tipping into fearfulness or reactivity.</p>

<h3>Train With Respect, Not Force</h3>
<p>Briards are exceptionally intelligent — they ranked among the dogs used by the French Army in both World Wars for their ability to carry out complex tasks. But that intelligence comes with an independent streak. Heavy-handed or purely correction-based training methods tend to backfire badly with this breed, creating resentment or shutdown. Positive reinforcement paired with clear, consistent boundaries works best. Keep training sessions short (15–20 minutes), varied, and engaging. A bored Briard is a creative — and often destructive — Briard.</p>

<h3>Respect the Herding Instinct</h3>
<p>Many Briards will instinctively attempt to herd children, other pets, or even guests by circling, nudging, or nipping at heels. This behavior isn't aggression — it's deeply ingrained instinct. Redirect it appropriately by channeling that energy into herding sports, agility, or structured fetch games. Teaching a reliable "leave it" and a solid recall is crucial for managing herding behaviors in a household setting. If you have young children, supervise interactions and teach the dog early that ankle-nipping is not acceptable.</p>

<h3>Master the Coat Before It Masters You</h3>
<p>The Briard's glorious double coat requires a serious commitment. Brush thoroughly at least 3–4 times per week using a quality pin brush and wide-toothed comb, working in sections all the way down to the skin — mats that form at the skin level are far more serious than surface tangles. Pay special attention to friction zones: behind the ears, under the collar, around the harness straps, and in the armpits. Keep the hair around the eyes trimmed or secured so your dog can see clearly, which directly affects its confidence and trainability. After outdoor adventures, check the beard and leg furnishings for debris, burrs, and moisture.</p>

<h3>Double Dewclaws Are a Signature — Care for Them</h3>
<p>The Briard is one of a handful of breeds that carries double dewclaws on its rear legs — in fact, this is a breed standard requirement from the AKC. These are functional toes, not vestigial extras, and they must be kept trimmed. Neglected double dewclaws can curl and grow into the leg, causing pain and infection. Include them in every nail trim session.</p>

<h3>Plan for Vigorous Daily Exercise</h3>
<p>A Briard needs a minimum of 60–90 minutes of meaningful physical activity every day — and "meaningful" is the key word. A casual stroll around the block won't cut it for a breed bred to work all day in the field. Long hikes, off-leash play in a securely fenced area, herding trials, agility courses, and bikejoring are all excellent outlets. A well-exercised Briard is a calm, pleasant housemate; an under-exercised one is an unpredictable, frustrated handful.</p>

<h3>Watch for Bloat Warning Signs</h3>
<p>As a deep-chested breed, the Briard is at elevated risk for gastric dilatation-volvulus (GDV), or bloat. Feed two smaller meals per day rather than one large meal, avoid vigorous exercise for at least an hour before and after eating, and use a slow-feeder bowl. Know the signs — unproductive retching, a distended abdomen, and restlessness — and treat any suspected bloat as a life-threatening emergency requiring immediate veterinary attention. Discuss prophylactic gastropexy with your vet, as this surgery can be performed at the time of spay or neuter and dramatically reduces the risk.</p>

<h3>Give This Breed a Job</h3>
<p>More than almost any other breed, the Briard needs a sense of purpose. Whether that's formal herding, competitive obedience, search and rescue work, therapy dog visits, or simply being a working partner on a farm, this breed flourishes when it has a role to fulfill. Owners who treat their Briard as merely a pet — without mental stimulation and structured activity — often find themselves with a frustrated, difficult dog. Give a Briard a job, and you'll unlock one of the most remarkable partnerships in the dog world.</p>
